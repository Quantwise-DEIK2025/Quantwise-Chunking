        "gold_answer": "Open science aims to enhance research quality, reproducibility, and accessibility by sharing data and artifacts openly to support transparency and democratization. However, empirical software engineering is fundamentally socio-technical, involving humans and real-world industrial contexts. This creates a conflict where the goal of openness clashes with the need to protect personal integrity, adhere to data protection legislation like GDPR, and safeguard company secrets and commercial interests.",

        "gold_answer": "Quantitative data is generally easier to anonymize and summarize through statistical measures, as identities are often linked to metadata rather than the data itself. In contrast, qualitative data is richer and tightly linked to its context, meaning that anonymization or removing context can render the data meaningless (an epistemological concern). Furthermore, qualitative data poses higher ethical risks regarding confidentiality and the potential to reveal sensitive opinions or company secrets that are difficult to filter out.",

        "gold_answer": "Adaptive value in machines refers to how a behavior fulfills a function for human stakeholders, affecting the machine's 'fitness' or likelihood of being propagated/copied. External incentives, such as maximizing user engagement on social media, create selective pressure for algorithms that achieve this goal effectively.  This can lead to unintended consequences like filter bubbles, where successful engagement-maximizing algorithms inadvertently increase political polarization or spread fake news because those behaviors make the platform more successful.",

However, transport networks involve intermediate stops where a potential flow between two locations (expected flow) is realized through a sequence of subsequent flows (observed flow) involving transfer hubs.

However, in the air-transport network, the observed flow includes both direct and transfer passengers, meaning individuals traveling via intermediate stops are counted multiple times (e.g., twice for one change), preventing a direct calculation of G.

Long-term resilience is defined by the positive real power adaptive capacity over time, relating to the energy remaining (fuel) in the system, which corresponds to the 'respond' and 'recover' phases of the DIRE curve.",

        "gold_answer": "The two galvanic mirrors are kept parallel and rotate at the same frequency, amplitude, and phase. This configuration ensures that the beam leaving GM2 remains parallel to the beam entering GM1 and hits the DMD at the same incident angle, allowing the DMD to reflect the beam back exactly in the opposite direction along the same line.",

        "question": "Describe the edge detection capability of the system: what mathematical property of the generated patterns enables it, and how does its efficiency compare to the method proposed by Liu et al.?",
        "gold_answer": "The system performs edge detection by exploiting the property that two adjacent patterns are shifted counterparts in the scanning direction ($P_{i-1}(u,v) = P_i(u-1,v)$), allowing edges to be reconstructed by subtracting correlated measurements ($y_i - y_{i-1}$). This method reduces the number of requisite patterns by 50 percent compared to the gradient ghost imaging method proposed by Liu et al.",

        "question": "What are the two steps involved in the calibration process to map the scanning beam's position to the galvanic mirror's voltage, and why is the output voltage preferred over the input voltage?",
        "gold_answer": "The calibration involves first locating the positions of the ends of the beam scanning to determine the scanning range, and second, extracting the mapping relationship between the galvanic mirror voltage outputs and the corresponding positions of square regions within that range. The output voltage is used because it provides a more accurate signal of the rotation angle than the input voltage.",

        "question": "In the experiment demonstrating dynamic scene imaging, what specific modification was made to the object plane setup, and why was the DMD chosen to work in binary mode?",
        "gold_answer": "For dynamic scene imaging, a second DMD was placed on the sample plane to display video sequences at 42 Hz. This object DMD was set to work in binary mode because its standard gray-scale projection uses temporal multiplexing, which is inconsistent with natural dynamic scenes and would create artifacts unlike real motion blur.",

        "question": "What specific factors determine the pixel resolution of the final reconstruction, and how does the current technology of galvanic mirrors limit this resolution?",
        "gold_answer": "The pixel resolution is jointly determined by the size of the SLM (DMD) micro-mirrors and the size of the scanning beam hitting the DMD. The resolution is limited by off-the-shelf galvanic mirrors, which typically support a beam diameter of only 3 to 7 mm, resulting in a maximum pixel resolution of about 200 by 200 pixels.",

Another limitation is that the scheme currently only works for structuring light using random patterns and is inapplicable for specific structured patterns like Hadamard or sinusoidal patterns.",
