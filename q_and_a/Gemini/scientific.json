    "gold_answer": "Wind generation impacts resilience differently depending on its utilization: if run at maximum output, it does not directly add inertia (affecting short-term resilience) but allows diesel generators to be taken off-line, which conserves fuel and increases long-term resilience. However, if the wind turbine is run below its maximum capability, the quick ramping capability of the inverter-based generation can be leveraged to maintain frequency stability, thereby increasing the system's short-term resilience.",

    "gold_answer": "The experiments utilized one bedrock sample and three granular soils (A, B, and C). Soil C is classified as the most homogeneous, with more than 90 percent of its grains having a diameter between 0.7 and 1 mm. Soil B follows, with grains mostly concentrated below 2.0 mm. Soil A is the most heterogeneous of the granular soils, consisting of a mixture of several grain sizes. The bedrock represents the sample with the largest particles.",

Singular Vector Pooling (SVP) addresses sign ambiguity by aligning singular vectors based on a reference and eliminating randomness by reversing the signs of vectors on the negative half-sphere.

This creates a scenario where the practical movement of vectors during learning might follow a longer path (SP2) rather than the real shortest path (SP1) due to the boundary.

In contrast, SVP transforms singular vectors into Euclidean space to make them directly learnable without such restricted guidance. When SVP is applied to the knowledge distillation scheme (KD-SVP), it improves the performance of the student network by approximately 1.7 percent (specifically 1.69 percent) for the CIFAR100 dataset compared to the original KD-SVD.",

        "gold_answer": "The ablation study indicates that the 'sign ambiguity removal' step is critical; without it, the network fails to learn entirely because singular vectors with similar information remain randomly distributed.

        "question": "Compared to alternative high-speed imaging methods like optical demultiplexer-based OCT or streak-mode OCT, what are the distinct advantages of the developed STDM-OCT system?",
        "gold_answer": "Compared to optical demultiplexer-based OCT, the STDM-OCT system avoids signal attenuation and decreased frequency interval resolution caused by limited channels, and it is more cost-effective as it does not require multiple DAQ boards and digitizers. Against streak-mode OCT, STDM-OCT provides a better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and fully utilizes the duty cycle without the issue of non-uniform camera exposure.",

        "question": "What volumetric imaging performance (volume rate and dimensions) was achieved by integrating GPU parallel processing with the STDM method, and how is this performance adjustable?",
        "gold_answer": "By integrating GPU parallel processing, the system achieved a volume rate of 8 volumes per second for an image range of 250 x 250 x 2048 pixels (covering 9 x 4.5 x 5 mm). This performance is adjustable based on experimental needs; for example, the system can be set to 2 volumes per second for a 16 x 8 x 5 mm range or 0.5 volumes per second for a 30 x 16 x 5 mm range.",

        "question": "How was the A-scan profiling of the IR card used to validate the Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) image merging process?",
        "gold_answer": "The TDM process was validated by comparing A-scan profiles of specific lines (L1 with L3 for forward scanning, and L2 with L4 for backward scanning) captured by the two alternating cameras. The profiles confirmed that despite being captured by different cameras and at different absolute time points, the structural information obtained at the same A-line positions was consistent, verifying the accuracy of the interleaving and flipping merging algorithms.",
