Under Article 28(1) of the TPD, the Commission must submit a report on the Directive's application 2 by 20 May 2021. The report must discuss, specifically, the elements of the Directive that should be reviewed given scientific and technical developments, including internationally agreed rules and standards on tobacco and related products.\nThe TPD has aimed to reduce tobacco consumption by 2% within five years of its transposition 3 . Based on the latest Eurobarometer 4 , smoking prevalence among those aged 15+ fell from 26% in 2014 to 23% in 2020 - a drop 5 of 3 percentage points since the TPD came into force, equivalent to 12.5%.

    "text": "The Commission developed the EU Common Entry Gate (EU-CEG) system to facilitate the reporting in electronic format of the information on ingredients and emissions required under Article 5. Overall, the EU-CEG system has operated smoothly and fulfilled its core objectives as a data repository 23 , while reducing the administrative burden for manufacturers, importers and national regulators. The Commission set up a Joint Action on Tobacco Control 24 to further help Member States analyse and publish EU-CEG data on ingredients and emissions. The Joint Action helped Member States to make information publicly available online, as required under Article 5(4). The publication process was difficult, partly due to some submitters misusing the confidentiality tag.\nThe EU-CEG system hosts a lot of valuable data and information. However, despite efforts via the Joint Action, Member States have so far seldom used it for enforcement and regulatory purposes. Moreover, the data are not complete for certain mandatory variables, e.g. sales data. EU-wide analysis, to look at the single market, is hindered by national 'ownership' of data, with some Member States unwilling to share their data. The EU-CEG is costly and resource intensive for the Commission. To date, only about half of the Member States have charged fees for handling information on ingredients under Article 5(8). Reference laboratories, established in several other\n19 Within the FCTC, the Working Group on Articles 9&10 (Regulation of the contents and disclosures of tobacco products) in which the EU is a key facilitator, looked at the methods. Such methods were also further developed by the WHO Tobacco Laboratory Network (TobLabNet). However, there has been no consensus among the FCTC Parties to approve any of the emission measurement methods for inclusion into the relevant FCTC guidelines.\n20 For TNCO measurement, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 3308) smoking regime (pu ff volume 35 mL, pu ff duration 2s, pu ff interval 60s) and Health Canada Intense (HCI) smoking regime (pu ff volume 55 mL, pu ff duration 2s, pu ff interval 30s) are the two approaches usually applied. Due to the different parameters used, higher quantities of tar, nicotine and CO are systematically measured in the HCI regime (with 110ml of puff volume captured per minute) compared to the ISO method (with 35ml of puff volume captured per minute).\n21 One of the elements influencing the real individual exposure of smokers is filter ventilation, a technical feature designed to dilute the inhaled smoke. This is because smokers, when smoking their cigarette, usually cover some of ventilation holes. In order to improve transparency about the characteristics of products on the EU-market, manufacturers and importers are required to report a set of cigarette-specific parameters which should be considered in conjunction with emission measurements when interpreting them: the total ventilation of the filter (0-100%), the drop of pressure with closed vents (mmH 2 O) and the drop of pressure with open vents (mmH 2 O). These data are available to the Member States for such analysis and should provide for unbiased product assessment without a need to modify the current TPD reference to the ISO methods.\n22 \n23 So far, over 5 500 economic operators applied for a submitter ID. Almost 2400 submitted their products (over 42 000 tobacco and 300 000 e-cigarettes are active in EU-CEG at the moment).\n24 This Joint Action ( brought 25 Member States together to help implement the TPD; with a cost of EUR 2.5 m (the EU contributed 80%).\npolicy areas, do not exist. The Joint Action improved the situation somewhat.

    "original_text": "The Commission developed the EU Common Entry Gate (EU-CEG) system to facilitate the reporting in electronic format of the information on ingredients and emissions required under Article 5. Overall, the EU-CEG system has operated smoothly and fulfilled its core objectives as a data repository 23 , while reducing the administrative burden for manufacturers, importers and national regulators. The Commission set up a Joint Action on Tobacco Control 24 to further help Member States analyse and publish EU-CEG data on ingredients and emissions. The Joint Action helped Member States to make information publicly available online, as required under Article 5(4). The publication process was difficult, partly due to some submitters misusing the confidentiality tag.\nThe EU-CEG system hosts a lot of valuable data and information. However, despite efforts via the Joint Action, Member States have so far seldom used it for enforcement and regulatory purposes. Moreover, the data are not complete for certain mandatory variables, e.g. sales data. EU-wide analysis, to look at the single market, is hindered by national 'ownership' of data, with some Member States unwilling to share their data. The EU-CEG is costly and resource intensive for the Commission. To date, only about half of the Member States have charged fees for handling information on ingredients under Article 5(8). Reference laboratories, established in several other\n19 Within the FCTC, the Working Group on Articles 9&10 (Regulation of the contents and disclosures of tobacco products) in which the EU is a key facilitator, looked at the methods. Such methods were also further developed by the WHO Tobacco Laboratory Network (TobLabNet). However, there has been no consensus among the FCTC Parties to approve any of the emission measurement methods for inclusion into the relevant FCTC guidelines.\n20 For TNCO measurement, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 3308) smoking regime (pu ff volume 35 mL, pu ff duration 2s, pu ff interval 60s) and Health Canada Intense (HCI) smoking regime (pu ff volume 55 mL, pu ff duration 2s, pu ff interval 30s) are the two approaches usually applied. Due to the different parameters used, higher quantities of tar, nicotine and CO are systematically measured in the HCI regime (with 110ml of puff volume captured per minute) compared to the ISO method (with 35ml of puff volume captured per minute).\n21 One of the elements influencing the real individual exposure of smokers is filter ventilation, a technical feature designed to dilute the inhaled smoke. This is because smokers, when smoking their cigarette, usually cover some of ventilation holes. In order to improve transparency about the characteristics of products on the EU-market, manufacturers and importers are required to report a set of cigarette-specific parameters which should be considered in conjunction with emission measurements when interpreting them: the total ventilation of the filter (0-100%), the drop of pressure with closed vents (mmH 2 O) and the drop of pressure with open vents (mmH 2 O). These data are available to the Member States for such analysis and should provide for unbiased product assessment without a need to modify the current TPD reference to the ISO methods.\n22 \n23 So far, over 5 500 economic operators applied for a submitter ID. Almost 2400 submitted their products (over 42 000 tobacco and 300 000 e-cigarettes are active in EU-CEG at the moment).\n24 This Joint Action ( brought 25 Member States together to help implement the TPD; with a cost of EUR 2.5 m (the EU contributed 80%).\npolicy areas, do not exist. The Joint Action improved the situation somewhat. Overall, however, most resources were still used for setting up and maintaining the data repository, in detriment of data analysis, research and policy development, which would allow the data to be used for meaningful action.\nThe practical experience of establishing the EU-CEG showed that creating an EU database with information on ingredients and emissions from tobacco products would be technically possible.

The EU-CEG contains over 300 000 active e-cigarettes, compared to over 42 000 active tobacco products 54 . In recent years, big tobacco companies have increased investments in ecigarettes.\nThe EU was the first regional jurisdiction to regulate them, including advertising. To capture a wide net of diverse products, the TPD broadly defines this category to encompass both the device,\n50 WHO 2020.

E-cigarettes' market presence is substantial, with 2019 data showing the UK as the largest market (EUR 2 417 m), followed by France (EUR 847 m), and Germany (EUR 673 m) and Poland.\n54 Open systems with refillable tanks are the most popular, followed by rechargeable devices with replaceable cartridges. While closed systems restrict device manipulation and reduce malpractice, open systems allow independent dosing and tailored interoperability, which can act as a gateway for user negligence.\nincluding its parts, and refill containers with nicotine containing e-liquid. This has provided legal clarity, particularly when compared to provisions on novel tobacco products, where the device is not specifically captured. The Commission adopted two implementing acts and a report on risks associated with refillable e-cigarettes 55 .\nOverall, Member States had a fairly good experience with implementing certain provisions on ecigarettes, with scope for improvement in other specific areas. While manufacturers and importers submit notifications to the competent authorities, in line with Article 20(2), more could be done to provide higher quality information, particularly on toxicological data and consistent nicotine doses upon consumption, e.g. by standardising assessment methods. Certain provisions have proven challenging to implement in practice, e.g. health warnings under Article 20(4)(b)(iii) not only apply to refill containers or pre-filled devices but also to the e-cigarette device itself. Further specification and more differentiated warnings would help, in particular when a product is marketed without a nicotine-containing liquid. Also, questions over interpretation were raised over i) labelling requirements for unit packets and outside packaging, ii) the information allowed under the exemption from the bans of promotional elements (e.g. nicotine content and information on flavourings), and iii) the limits for the tank size.\nApplying Article 20(5) - banning commercial communications and sponsorship activities to promote e-cigarettes - continues to be challenging, especially in information society services and on social media where young people are particularly exposed/targeted.\nRegarding reporting market surveillance activities, Member States have a legal obligation to report dangerous e-cigarettes, chargers supplied with them and refill containers in the Safety Gate/RAPEX, as well as, measures taken against them. The Information and Communication System for Market Surveillance (ICSMS) is also available to authorities to exchange information on non-compliant products. However, the use of these tools by Member States is uneven.\nSafety concerns related to e-cigarettes spiralled worldwide in 2019 with 'EVALI' (E-cigarette or Vaping Associated Lung Injury) cases rising sharply in the USA 56 . These cases have since been linked to cannabis extract and/or vitamin E acetate containing e-liquids. EU countries have not observed this trend, possibly due in part to the specificities of e-cigarette regulation under the TPD, notably additive restrictions, e.g. a ban of vitamins in nicotine-containing liquids. These events show that the toxicological effects of the heated and inhaled forms of ingredients of both nicotine-containing and (thus far unregulated) nicotine-free e-cigarettes should be highlighted. The TPD also sets a maximum nicotine concentration of 20 mg/ml and overall this has been implemented, although industry use of technical features can increase nicotine uptake per puff.\nThe industry presents e-cigarettes as reduced-risk products and claims that they help smokers to quit.

For users of electronic cigarettes, they found moderate weight of evidence for risks of local irritative damage to the respiratory tract and moderate, but a growing level of evidence from human data suggesting that electronic cigarettes have harmful health effects, especially but not limited to the cardiovascular system. More so, they found weak to moderate weight of evidence for risks of carcinogenicity of the respiratory tract due to long-term, cumulative exposure to nitrosamines and due to exposure to acetaldehyde and formaldehyde and concluded that weight of evidence for risk of poisoning and injuries due to burns and explosion is strong. They also found weak to moderate weight of evidence for several risks related to second-hand exposure. Overall, there is moderate evidence that electronic cigarettes are a gateway to smoking for young people and strong evidence that flavours have a relevant contribution for attractiveness of use of electronic cigarette and initiation. On the other hand, there is weak evidence for the support of electronic cigarettes' effectiveness in helping smokers to quit while the evidence on smoking reduction is assessed as weak to moderate 59 .\n\nHighlights the significant market presence of e-cigarettes within the EU, emphasizing regulatory challenges related to flavors, advertising, and potential gateway effects for young people.",
    "original_text": "E-cigarettes, containing nicotine but no tobacco, are a specific diverse product category, accounting for up to 7% of the national EU markets, in terms of value, for tobacco and related products 53 . The EU-CEG contains over 300 000 active e-cigarettes, compared to over 42 000 active tobacco products 54 . In recent years, big tobacco companies have increased investments in ecigarettes.\nThe EU was the first regional jurisdiction to regulate them, including advertising. To capture a wide net of diverse products, the TPD broadly defines this category to encompass both the device,\n50 WHO 2020.

E-cigarettes' market presence is substantial, with 2019 data showing the UK as the largest market (EUR 2 417 m), followed by France (EUR 847 m), and Germany (EUR 673 m) and Poland.\n54 Open systems with refillable tanks are the most popular, followed by rechargeable devices with replaceable cartridges. While closed systems restrict device manipulation and reduce malpractice, open systems allow independent dosing and tailored interoperability, which can act as a gateway for user negligence.\nincluding its parts, and refill containers with nicotine containing e-liquid. This has provided legal clarity, particularly when compared to provisions on novel tobacco products, where the device is not specifically captured. The Commission adopted two implementing acts and a report on risks associated with refillable e-cigarettes 55 .\nOverall, Member States had a fairly good experience with implementing certain provisions on ecigarettes, with scope for improvement in other specific areas. While manufacturers and importers submit notifications to the competent authorities, in line with Article 20(2), more could be done to provide higher quality information, particularly on toxicological data and consistent nicotine doses upon consumption, e.g. by standardising assessment methods. Certain provisions have proven challenging to implement in practice, e.g. health warnings under Article 20(4)(b)(iii) not only apply to refill containers or pre-filled devices but also to the e-cigarette device itself. Further specification and more differentiated warnings would help, in particular when a product is marketed without a nicotine-containing liquid. Also, questions over interpretation were raised over i) labelling requirements for unit packets and outside packaging, ii) the information allowed under the exemption from the bans of promotional elements (e.g. nicotine content and information on flavourings), and iii) the limits for the tank size.\nApplying Article 20(5) - banning commercial communications and sponsorship activities to promote e-cigarettes - continues to be challenging, especially in information society services and on social media where young people are particularly exposed/targeted.\nRegarding reporting market surveillance activities, Member States have a legal obligation to report dangerous e-cigarettes, chargers supplied with them and refill containers in the Safety Gate/RAPEX, as well as, measures taken against them. The Information and Communication System for Market Surveillance (ICSMS) is also available to authorities to exchange information on non-compliant products. However, the use of these tools by Member States is uneven.\nSafety concerns related to e-cigarettes spiralled worldwide in 2019 with 'EVALI' (E-cigarette or Vaping Associated Lung Injury) cases rising sharply in the USA 56 . These cases have since been linked to cannabis extract and/or vitamin E acetate containing e-liquids. EU countries have not observed this trend, possibly due in part to the specificities of e-cigarette regulation under the TPD, notably additive restrictions, e.g. a ban of vitamins in nicotine-containing liquids. These events show that the toxicological effects of the heated and inhaled forms of ingredients of both nicotine-containing and (thus far unregulated) nicotine-free e-cigarettes should be highlighted. The TPD also sets a maximum nicotine concentration of 20 mg/ml and overall this has been implemented, although industry use of technical features can increase nicotine uptake per puff.\nThe industry presents e-cigarettes as reduced-risk products and claims that they help smokers to quit. However, worrying trends of popularity 57 exist among youths. There is strong evidence that flavours in e-liquids are attractive to youths and adults.

A characterising flavour in the Directive is defined as a ' clearly noticeable smell or taste other than one of tobacco, resulting from an additive or a combination of additives, including, but not limited to, fruit, spice, herbs, alcohol, candy, menthol or vanilla, which is noticeable before or during the consumption of the tobacco product '. 1\nBased on Directive 2014/40/EU Article 7, section (3) and (4), the Commission has developed two legal acts: Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/786 5 of 18 May 2016, laying down the procedure for the establishment and operation of an independent advisory panel assisting the Member States and the Commission in determining whether tobacco products have a characterising flavour (Figure 1); and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/779 8 of 18 May 2016, laying down uniform rules as regards the procedures for determining whether a tobacco product has a characterising flavour.\nFigure 1. Overview of the procedure of the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/786\nArticle 7(4) of Directive 2014/40/EU provides that when determining whether a tobacco product has a characterising flavour, EU MS and the Commission may consult an independent advisory panel ('IAP' or 'the panel'). The procedures and operation of the IAP are outlined in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/786.\nCommission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/786 stipulates the IAP should be assisted by a technical group of sensory and chemical assessors ('TG' or 'the technical group') for the technical assessment of test products. The TG was established through a public procurement procedure, as part of Single Framework Contract (Chafea/2016/Health/36) to provide services to support the assessment of characterising flavours in tobacco products, commissioned to an external contractor (the 'EUREST -FLAVOURS' Consortium). Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/786 specifies that the technical group should carry out sensory and chemical assessments based on a comparison of the smelling properties of the test product with those of reference products and where it is considered applicable, the sensory analysis can be complemented by chemical analysis of the product.\nSensory, including smelling, analysis is an established scientific discipline that applies principles of experimental design and statistical analysis to assess and describe perceptions of the human senses, including smell, for the purposes of evaluating consumer products. The analysis should be conducted\non the basis of an established methodology and that the panel shall specify and, as appropriate update the methodology for the technical assessment of test products. In developing the methodology, the panel shall take into consideration, as appropriate input from the technical group.\nThe Commission may request IAP for an opinion on whether a tobacco product has a characterising flavour. Where IAP considers it necessary for the purposes of providing an opinion, it shall request input from the Technical Group (TG) established in accordance with Article 12. In forming its opinion, the panel shall have regard to the information and data obtained from the technical group. It may also have regard to any other information at its disposal that it considers authoritative and relevant, including information resulting from reporting obligations pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 2014/40/EU 4 .\nArticle 2(28) of the Tobacco Products Directive 2014/40/EU 8 , defines the ' substantial change of circumstances ' as an increase of the sales volumes by product category by at least 10 % in at least five Member States (MS), based on sales data transmitted in accordance with Article 5(6) of the Directive or an increase of the level of prevalence of use in the under 25 years of age consumer group, by at least 5% in at least five MS for the respective product category, based on the Special Eurobarometer 385 report of May 2012 or equivalent prevalence studies.\nIn June 2022, the Commission published a Report 9 indicating that the sales volume of Heated Tobacco Products (HTPs) had increased by more than 10% in 10 MS and that HTPs accounted for 3.33% of the total sales volume. This finding triggered a substantial change of circumstances for HTPs. On this basis, the existing prohibition of selling tobacco products with a characterising flavour the ban was extended to HTPs. This extension was implemented through a delegated Directive 10 under Article 7(12) and Article 11(6) of Directive 2014/40/EU. Previously, this prohibition only applied to cigarettes and rollyour-own tobacco.

A characterising flavour in the Directive is defined as a ' clearly noticeable smell or taste other than one of tobacco, resulting from an additive or a combination of additives, including, but not limited to, fruit, spice, herbs, alcohol, candy, menthol or vanilla, which is noticeable before or during the consumption of the tobacco product '. 1\nBased on Directive 2014/40/EU Article 7, section (3) and (4), the Commission has developed two legal acts: Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/786 5 of 18 May 2016, laying down the procedure for the establishment and operation of an independent advisory panel assisting the Member States and the Commission in determining whether tobacco products have a characterising flavour (Figure 1); and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/779 8 of 18 May 2016, laying down uniform rules as regards the procedures for determining whether a tobacco product has a characterising flavour.\nFigure 1. Overview of the procedure of the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/786\nArticle 7(4) of Directive 2014/40/EU provides that when determining whether a tobacco product has a characterising flavour, EU MS and the Commission may consult an independent advisory panel ('IAP' or 'the panel'). The procedures and operation of the IAP are outlined in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/786.\nCommission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/786 stipulates the IAP should be assisted by a technical group of sensory and chemical assessors ('TG' or 'the technical group') for the technical assessment of test products. The TG was established through a public procurement procedure, as part of Single Framework Contract (Chafea/2016/Health/36) to provide services to support the assessment of characterising flavours in tobacco products, commissioned to an external contractor (the 'EUREST -FLAVOURS' Consortium). Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/786 specifies that the technical group should carry out sensory and chemical assessments based on a comparison of the smelling properties of the test product with those of reference products and where it is considered applicable, the sensory analysis can be complemented by chemical analysis of the product.\nSensory, including smelling, analysis is an established scientific discipline that applies principles of experimental design and statistical analysis to assess and describe perceptions of the human senses, including smell, for the purposes of evaluating consumer products. The analysis should be conducted\non the basis of an established methodology and that the panel shall specify and, as appropriate update the methodology for the technical assessment of test products. In developing the methodology, the panel shall take into consideration, as appropriate input from the technical group.\nThe Commission may request IAP for an opinion on whether a tobacco product has a characterising flavour. Where IAP considers it necessary for the purposes of providing an opinion, it shall request input from the Technical Group (TG) established in accordance with Article 12. In forming its opinion, the panel shall have regard to the information and data obtained from the technical group. It may also have regard to any other information at its disposal that it considers authoritative and relevant, including information resulting from reporting obligations pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 2014/40/EU 4 .\nArticle 2(28) of the Tobacco Products Directive 2014/40/EU 8 , defines the ' substantial change of circumstances ' as an increase of the sales volumes by product category by at least 10 % in at least five Member States (MS), based on sales data transmitted in accordance with Article 5(6) of the Directive or an increase of the level of prevalence of use in the under 25 years of age consumer group, by at least 5% in at least five MS for the respective product category, based on the Special Eurobarometer 385 report of May 2012 or equivalent prevalence studies.\nIn June 2022, the Commission published a Report 9 indicating that the sales volume of Heated Tobacco Products (HTPs) had increased by more than 10% in 10 MS and that HTPs accounted for 3.33% of the total sales volume. This finding triggered a substantial change of circumstances for HTPs. On this basis, the existing prohibition of selling tobacco products with a characterising flavour the ban was extended to HTPs. This extension was implemented through a delegated Directive 10 under Article 7(12) and Article 11(6) of Directive 2014/40/EU. Previously, this prohibition only applied to cigarettes and rollyour-own tobacco. Additionally, the Commission eliminated the option for Member States to exempt these products from the labelling requirements outlined in Article 9(2) and Article 10 of Directive 2014/40/EU.\nThis report provides the specifications of the established methodology used to provide an opinion to the Commission on whether a tobacco product (cigarette, roll-your-own, HTP) has a characterising flavour, based on input from the technical group.",

Subsequently, the results of each assessment are sensory panel specific, and hence not straightforwardly comparable across sensory panels, with each sensory expert panel naming attributes and rating their intensity in a way which reflects the specifics of the training and the composition of its members.\nThe chosen methodology described in this report can be compared across sensory panels, i.e. the perception of all flavour attributes by sensory assessors and by consumers is driven by the presence of specific concentrations of individual flavour compounds. Furthermore, the sense of olfaction in humans is extremely specific, and a particular feature of olfaction is that the response of assessors to individual stereoisomers of the same compound differs both qualitatively (in terms of odour characteristic) and quantitatively (in terms of odour intensity). The human olfactory system is able to combine stimulation by several odourants to form a composite odour. Thus, they may use terms such as fruity or floral to describe mixtures of individual flavour compounds which impart individual fruity odours reminiscent of apples, blackberries or raisins, or individual floral odours, such as those resembling violets or roses.\nNevertheless, perception, recognition and identification of flavour compounds, mainly occurs at the level of the individual chemical compounds and mixtures thereof. The methodology further uses anchoring the results of the sensory evaluation of tobacco products to verifiable chemical standards. The attribute intensity results generated are therefore reflective of both the sample evaluated and the sensory panel that made the evaluation. Hence, for the application of Directive 2014/40/EU and to fit regulatory needs it is essential to anchor the results of the sensory evaluation of tobacco products to verifiable chemical standards. Chemical reference standards of known concentration and purity, and therefore known flavour character and intensity, can provide such anchoring. Therefore, reference standards have been used during the training of the sensory panel, to define the existence and intensity scales used by individual assessors and the sensory panel as a unity. This allows for a sensory panel to be trained using the same approach, using the same standards and vocabulary and hence these are applicable by both the industry and regulators, within other settings.\nThe chosen sensory assessment for sensory expert panel members to identify characterising flavour attributes, descriptive profiling, is a well-established method used in the field of sensory analysis. Attributes which are absent from individual samples are scored 0 by individual assessors. When a given attribute is present at the lowest possible intensity it is possible for the assessor to detect, it is assigned a score of 1.

Furthermore, 4 reference tobacco products (i.e. non-commercial, research-only tobacco products), two boxed cigarettes and two ground tobacco products, containing no additives were also obtained from the Centre for Tobacco Reference Products of the University of Kentucky. These products were included in the testing program, blind-coded together with routine test samples. Therefore, in total, 123 products were purchased for testing which constitute the fourth list of products (ranging from two to eight products per EU MS as per the random sampling plan).\nTG tested the 123 products of the fourth list with sensory analysis (descriptive profiling) and chemical analysis, in order to determine the sensory and chemical characteristics. Some of the products were suspected to have characterising flavour based on chemical and sensory analysis and were removed from the fourth list in order to create a final list of products (The overview of the number of samples by EU MS is depicted in Table 3, Annex I).",

To minimize possible expectation bias in future evaluations, no feedback on sample evaluations is provided to assessors following descriptive profiling of test samples.\nThe expert sensory panel that carries out the technical sensory assessments of test products has been trained using a fixed vocabulary -directly linked to chemical substances and individual odour attributes- rather than a vocabulary derived from, and associated with, a particular sensory panel. Specific labels are used to identify specific chemicals. Thus, assessors trained to evaluate the flavour of tobacco products are able to identify and rate the intensity of individual flavour compounds (such as β -ionone), rather than refer to them by means of collective terms that may be sensory panel specific (such as floral).\nAssessors must not bring personal effects, food or drink into the Sensory Evaluation suite. They must also refrain from wearing scented products. Instructions concerning the sequence in which the test samples evaluated are provided by the software. Indicators are provided in the software to direct the sensory assessor in the sample evaluation process. A 10-minutes break is provided for assessors between each evaluation session. Assessors are not permitted to discuss the samples or attributes associated with samples at any time.",

There is a risk when opening or refilling that e-liquid from refillable ecigarettes is spilled and comes into contact with the skin.

This is for example the case in Sweden and the United Kingdom. In Sweden very few eating and drinking establishments have enclosed smoking rooms, despite the fact that the legislation allows it. In other Member States the high exposure rates are either the result of a lack of enforcement or of a lack of ambition in terms of legislation or both.

    "text": "While the exposure to tobacco smoke in private places (homes, cars) is not covered by the Recommendation, a number of Member States have nonetheless provided information. The underlying reason is that the Recommendation invites Member States to pay particular attention to the protection of children and adolescents. In Member States with comprehensive smoke-free legislation in public places and high enforcement levels, smoking in private places is the most likely risk for children and adolescents to be exposed to second hand smoking.\nMost Member States have not introduced legislative measures to protect children against tobacco smoke in homes and cars. Cyprus has banned smoking in cars if children under 16 are present. Similar legislation has been proposed by the Irish Ministry of Health. The National Public Health Institute in Sweden has been tasked to prepare a report on exposure to tobacco smoke as a basis for potential new legislation, which would include regulation of smoking in outdoor areas, particularly those that are frequented by children and adolescents. In Norway the government has proposed a ban on exposing children to tobacco smoke. Icelandic legislation imposes a duty of care to protect children from tobacco smoke in all areas.\nFigure 5 summarises the information concerning exposure in private settings.

    "original_text": "While the exposure to tobacco smoke in private places (homes, cars) is not covered by the Recommendation, a number of Member States have nonetheless provided information. The underlying reason is that the Recommendation invites Member States to pay particular attention to the protection of children and adolescents. In Member States with comprehensive smoke-free legislation in public places and high enforcement levels, smoking in private places is the most likely risk for children and adolescents to be exposed to second hand smoking.\nMost Member States have not introduced legislative measures to protect children against tobacco smoke in homes and cars. Cyprus has banned smoking in cars if children under 16 are present. Similar legislation has been proposed by the Irish Ministry of Health. The National Public Health Institute in Sweden has been tasked to prepare a report on exposure to tobacco smoke as a basis for potential new legislation, which would include regulation of smoking in outdoor areas, particularly those that are frequented by children and adolescents. In Norway the government has proposed a ban on exposing children to tobacco smoke. Icelandic legislation imposes a duty of care to protect children from tobacco smoke in all areas.\nFigure 5 summarises the information concerning exposure in private settings.

In the Member States that allow vending machines provisions are in place to limit uncontrolled access to tobacco products. Restrictions range from ID control systems to the need of adequate supervision. Some Member States also regulate where the machines can be installed (e.g. Portugal and Spain).

In four Member States (Hungary, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden) the minimum pack size is 19 cigarettes. Italy specifies that cigarettes must be sold in either packets of 10 or 20. In the UK the minimum pack size is 10 cigarettes. Furthermore, Slovenia and Latvia ban the sale of single cigarettes.\n14 Member States regulate ingredients. Poland bans the use of ingredients, which enhance the addictive properties of tobacco. Three Member States (Belgium, Romania, UK) have introduced different varieties of positive lists of ingredients allowed to be used in tobacco products. Lithuania has introduced a negative list which restricts specific additives (e.g. vanilla root and clove) from being included in tobacco products and the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria and Slovakia have a combination of positive and negative lists.

Public approval of a smoke-free hospitality industry continues to grow in Germany. According to a recent\n32 Semple S, van Tongeren M, Galea KS, MacCalman L, Gee I, Parry O, Naji A, Ayres JG.
