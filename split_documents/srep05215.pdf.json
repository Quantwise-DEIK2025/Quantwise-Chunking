Proposes two conditions: a strong condition with no substitution and a weak condition with substitution, showing that sustainable activities form a subset of a N-level union.\n\nDaniel S. Zachary *\nResources Centre for Environmental Technologies, Public Research Centre Henri Tudor, 29, avenue J.F. Kennedy, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\nThis paper develops a framework to determine the sustainability of a general activity. We define an activity as an action or process that uses one or more resources and that responds either wholly or partially to a demand. A definition for sustainability is developed and is contingent on whether or not an activity can be sustained according to the available resources, the duration of an activity, the cost of its execution, or whether substitution is possible. A sustainability condition is met when the duration, cost and the chain of dependent activities satisfies the demand. Two conditions for sustainability are developed: a strong condition when the demand is met with no substitution and a weak condition when the demand is met via substitution. In the latter case, we show that the set of all sustainable activities is a subset of a N-level union of sustainable activities and forms a topological cover.\nI nthe 21st Century, humans are faced with the extraordinary challenge of developing methodologies to manage Earth's limited resources in a sustainable way 1-4 . A widely accepted definition of sustainability has its origins in the Brundtland Commission statement of 1987, Our Common Future 5 : ''Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.'' This normative description summarizes the document and proposes a set of fundamental qualities for sustainability, including the notion of being global (encompassing everyone) and providing for intra- and intergenerational equity and justice. This document proposes the reduction of inequities for all as well as providing a way to protect the common good for the poorest and wealthiest nations, not only for the present, but also for future generations. Indeed the very notion of sustainability, 'needs to be sustained' in light of the self-evident prospect that we have a limited supply of available resources.\nAs a consequence, scientists continue to seek a better understanding of the fundamental character of the interactions between nature and society and to explore whether these interactions are along sustainable trajectories. Policy makers have also tried to implement these concepts. Kofi Annan's report to the United Nations, We the peoples, The role of the United Nations in the 21st Century 6 , echoes this notion. Activated by an international effort, Annan claimed, ''globalization must be built on the great enabling force of the market ... and requiring a broader effort to create a shared future, based upon our common humanity in all its diversity.'' In the years following the Brundtland Report, a set of three pillars (we use interchangeably with the term dimensions) were conceived, namely, the environmental, economic, and social pillars. Then in 1992, the United Nations held the ''The Earth Summit'' conference in Rio de Janeiro. It was here that the agenda for the 21st century was established (Agenda 21) and the 'triplet' was solidified into the well known Venn diagram that has since become an icon for visualizing sustainability.\nIn the attempts to connect the potentially conflicting issues from each dimension, many subsequent interpretations and a host of definitions based on different academic disciplinary perspectives, ideological preferences, [and] even political expediency were developed. Some well known and constructive definitions include those for sustainable production 1 , sustainable biophysical systems 2 , eco-systems goods and services 4 , and others. Using some of these definitions, holistic approaches have been sought in response to the diverse challenges 7 and have had some success in building frameworks to address sustainability problems.\nThere is a clear imbalance in terms of analytical work on the three dimensions. Environmental and the closelyrelated ecological sciences, most naturally accessible to modelling, have developed the first among the three 8-11 , followed by quantitative economic approaches towards sustainability 12 , and then much later by work on social sustainability 13 . Social sustainability is also commonly understood as a 'weak pillar', in part because of the difficulty in formulating issues into an analytic framework. Some progress has none-the-less been made 14-16 . Despite the differences of the three, there is a general agreement that holistic approaches to sustainable development must encompass 1) the interactions across all three dimensions, 2) multiscale approaches 17 , and 3) complexity 18-20 . Apart from these concerns, the modeller must balance detail and relevance since a model will only be as good as the available input information and the associated uncertainties.

In these early years, the societal dimension was treated as a subsystem of the ecosystem. In the same time period, Karl Polanyi produced his work on The Great Transformation (1944) 22 and developed the concept of societal and cultural economics. In the 1960s, a number of essays describing the interactions between the economic and ecosystems appeared, including Kenneth E. Boulding's work ''The economics of the coming spaceship Earth'' 23 and Herman E. Daly's contribution entitled ''On Economics as a life cycle'' 24 . In the 1980s, a next major step came when regular scientific activities commenced in the field of EE. In 1984, the symposium entitled ''Integrating Ecology and Economics'' was hosted in Sweden by Ann-Mari Jansson 8 and brought together, for the first time, a large number of ecosystem ecologists and mainstream environmental economists. In 1988, the International Society for Ecological Economics (ISEE) was founded, and, in February 1989,\nAlso, during this period, the interdisciplinary fields of sustainability science (SS) 28,30-32 emerged as a set of disciplines addressing the central issues of sustainability. A comprehensive definition is proposed by Kieffer et al. (2003) 33 : ''[Sustainable science is] the cultivation, integration, and application of knowledge about Earth systems gained especially from the holistic and historical sciences ... coordinated with knowledge about human interrelationships gained from the social sciences and humanities, in order to evaluate, mitigate, and minimize the consequences''.\nDespite the definitions available, no consensus on a theoretical framework has yet been defined in either interdisciplinary movements 25,27 . A current priority theme is the development of strategies dealing with the dynamical interfaces between dimensions 25,34 and the uncertainties of measurable parameters.\nAmodern technique in dealing with the problem of interfaces has been the use of systems approaches (SA) where tools have traditionally been used to treat two or more domains of research. In SA, different metrics for each discipline are treated separately 3 . The method uses dynamic processes 35 (time dependent), is cross dimensional (economic, social, and environmental) and is able to handle complex problems 36 (interconnected, interwoven, with feedback) as well as problems with multi-variables. As with most approaches dealing with complex issues, SA employs numerical methods that can handle problems of this nature, but these approaches are not always easily interpretable.\nAnother quantitative method includes the use of sustainability assessment maps (SAMs). These maps use indicators such as costs, profits, numbers of jobs, environmental impact and types and quantities of natural capital. A score is set up to weigh each decision in\nterms of its sustainability 3 . The approach is appealing for policy makers because it is easy to communicate and understand, although it should not be considered a panacea 37 . Some problems include the aforementioned 'imbalance between ecological modelling and the other two branches' 8-11 , the weak integration of data into a single, dynamical framework since SAMs are static 37 , the unresolved issue of what to do when conflicting goals and interactions between indicators have not been sufficiently considered, and finally, the mismatch of scales (local to global). The last issues is especially important in the social dimension 11,37 .\nSeveral other approaches have been pursued to overcome these challenges, including the multivariate analysis 38 and comprehensive indicator approaches 39 , both having a certain degree of success in specific applications 37 . The issues of complexity, non-locality, and multi-scales, still proved difficult to address with these methods, both in terms of calculation and interpretation. It is not surprising that no single approach for modelling sustainability has yet emerged. Furthermore, no consensus exists for a comprehensive list of sustainability topics. A good compilation of theoretical approaches has nonetheless been developed (adapted from van den Bergh, 1996) 40 and is given in Table 1.\nThe previously mentioned approaches suggest the interconnectivity of sustainability. An underlying concept connecting the dimensions is cost . This is not necessarily a monetary value, except in the obvious case of commodities in the economic dimension, but a parameter used to weight and compare decisions. Monetary values are more difficult to assign to environmental costs, although methodology has been developed to do so 41,42 . Impact has also been evaluated in other contexts, for example, direct human activity in the environment via population growth 43 . Also, not surprisingly, it is difficult to assign a monetary cost for societal concerns, but a relative weighting can still be done, especially for issues at a local level where a consensus on the social cost is easier to obtain.\nFor example, when dealing only with energy resources and longterm planning, the model should provide solutions that approach those of classic technoeconomic models (e.g., MARKAL, the MARket ALlocation model) 44 . When details are available (e.g., costs of fuel, maintenance, and investments), the model should be readily adaptable to search for and test different hypotheses. Indeed, the model should provide a means to make decisions or at least be flexible enough so that a decision process can be developed around the core model.\nThe model should also be adaptable to handle dynamic systems such as the dynamic resource stocks of limited resources (e.g., fossil fuels) or linked (indirect) resources typically modelled in ecological economic literature (e.g., tuna: the harvesting of this top predator fish and its dependency on herrings).\nEnvironmental costs, though less tangible, can also be determined via an impact or damage. A number of air pollutants, including CO2, nitrous oxides, hydrocarbons, and particulate matter are emitted from the vehicle and damage or impact the health of the surrounding human and plant environment. Although difficult to calculate on an individual basis, the damage to humans can be assessed in terms of the health costs or decreased longevity as a result of the diminished environment 42 .\nThe social costs depend on the social milieu. For example, the social acceptability of taking the bike instead of the car, may or may not be important. In some localities, residents consider it to be more socially responsible to use a bike for a short trip, especially if the other choice was an oversized car; yet in other societies, for cultural reasons, the consideration is just the opposite. This reality suggests that social costs may still be evaluated, but more as a means of weighing two or more decisions based on their local acceptance.\nIn this paper, we break down the concept of sustainable development into its building block activities; these can then be tested for the sustainability condition as we will show in the next few sections.\nFigure 1 | Schematic of dependencies (N 5 5) for the base activity x 1 1 using capacity c 1 1 .\nFurthermore, we propose that sustainable development occurs only when the ensemble of activities that make up the development are all sustainable.",

        "text": "Provides supporting evidence for the argument on economic inequality.\n\nExamples are useful to elaborate the notion of activities and their classification. We start with the simple example, the need (demand) to take a short trip and propose that only two modes of transportation are available: a bike and a car. First, we consider the resources required by each activity. Does the biker have enough stored biochemical energy available or is there enough gas in the car tank? If not, what are the costs of a snack for the biker to 'energize up' or the costs to refuel the car? If a longer trip was planned, we would have to include the purchase (replacement) and operational costs (maintenance) for both car and bike and include the amount recovered (salvage value) for each. For longer planning scenarios, covering decades of time, we must also consider the projected change of technology (e.g., a petroleum or diesel car replaced by a fuel cell car).\nIf the bike is chosen and the rider has enough energy to make the trip, then the trip is sustainable since t , t max and we assume Cbike , C max . According to this scheme, the journey completed by a car is also sustainable if the car completes the journey before the tank is empty ( t , t max ) and Ccar , C max .\nOther indirect consequences come out of this example. Theoretically, the 'clean' bike trip can negatively impact the environment. Prior to the trip, the bicyclist might be inclined to eat an apple for energy and therefore indirectly supports an apple farmer. A truck driver who is transporting the apple to the market is also supported by this activity, albeit marginally. The truck consequently contributes to the emission load. Therefore, secondary environmental costs that are not usually foreseen when riding a bike might be taken into account. To be thorough, we should not stop here; we should include the manufacturing costs needed to build the truck, bike, or car. We should also include the impact from the exhaust of all the commuters who journeyed to and from the factory to build the bike, car, or truck. The list would go on and on and the problem\nTable 3 | Eight possibilities for sustainable (S) or unsustainable (US) activities\n\nUS US US US US US, Level(s).Level(s) = single single. US US US US US US, Duration.t , t max = no.

S/US, Level(s).Level(s) = multiple. S/US, Duration.t , t max = yes. S/US, Cost.C , C max = yes\nquickly becomes an intractable one to assess. Although arguably small, the ramifications of activities should be considered. To a degree, these are reminiscent of the Life Cycle Assessment considerations of the 'cradle-to-grave' analysis and Boundary Critique issues 45 associated with typical rigid boundaries of problems. The model should be expandable to account for these issues by adding 'higher-order terms'. The question of how these terms are weighted is probably less important than being consistent. (See Appendix item Generalizing the activity to include higher-order dependencies.)\nOne method to determine the higher-order terms in this case would be using the fraction of the weight of the one apple eaten compared to the weight of the entire lot on the truck. This information might be very difficult to ascertain and statistical models would be needed. The number of linked activities or levels N or the number of higher-order considerations will each have to be determined in light of the knowledge and uncertainty of the problem. When the higher-order term is sufficiently uncertain, the calculation should then stop.\nNow consider two sets of capacities, renewables V r and nonrenewables V nr , as given in Figure 1,\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n/C8\n/C9\n/C8\n/C9\nc 1 1 , c 2 11 , c 4 1121 , c 4 1122 [ V nr , c 3 111 , c 5 11221 , c 3 112 [ V r , and as an example, an 'actual' situation, c 3 111 , c 4 1121 , c 5 11221 , c 2 12 /C8 /C9 [ V /C3 , V /C3 ( V nr | V nr .

Though the demand in this example is constant, it could be time dependent and therefore represents a national transportation activity. Scenarios developing replacement technologies (fuel cells) using renewable energies (solar, wind, etc.), for the most part, have not yet been developed on large scales, and therefore, the uncertainty of replaceable technologies limits the knowledge for substitution. Not surprisingly, this important demand is considered unsustainable and, subsequently, is a major area of concern and requires ongoing development and research.\nApart from the previously mentioned energy, transportation and ecological applications, other prime domains include agriculture, business, and architecture, and these can also be addressed with the model. A number of parameters and concepts can directly address the general definitions. Sustainable agriculture, for example, is characterized by a number of requirements and can be met by the framework developed here. These include:\n1. Satisfying human food and fiber needs (activities meeting a demand, Eqs. 18, 19).\n2. Enhancing environmental quality and the natural resource based upon the agricultural economy (reducing I and therefore CE , Eqs. 4-6).\n3. Making the most efficient use of non-renewable resources and on-farm resources (replacing ~ c 0 s with higher level c 's or with other c 's having lower costs).\n4.

Sustaining the economic viability of farm operations (reducing CF , Eq. 9), and enhancing the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole (reducing CS , Eq. 10) 48 .\nSustainable business includes activities that are environmentally friendly processes, products, and manufacturing activities (reducing CE , Eqs. 4-6, 11) while maintaining a profit (reducing CF , Eq. 9) 49 .\nFinally, sustainable architecture is typified by the promotion of smart growth and shorter commuting distances (reducing CE Eqs.46, 11), reducing the environmental footprint (or activities with acceptable CF , Eq. 10 and CE , Eqs. 4-6, 11), and avoidance of globally uniform design (reducing CS , Eq. 10).",
        "original_text": "Examples are useful to elaborate the notion of activities and their classification. We start with the simple example, the need (demand) to take a short trip and propose that only two modes of transportation are available: a bike and a car. First, we consider the resources required by each activity. Does the biker have enough stored biochemical energy available or is there enough gas in the car tank? If not, what are the costs of a snack for the biker to 'energize up' or the costs to refuel the car? If a longer trip was planned, we would have to include the purchase (replacement) and operational costs (maintenance) for both car and bike and include the amount recovered (salvage value) for each. For longer planning scenarios, covering decades of time, we must also consider the projected change of technology (e.g., a petroleum or diesel car replaced by a fuel cell car).\nIf the bike is chosen and the rider has enough energy to make the trip, then the trip is sustainable since t , t max and we assume Cbike , C max . According to this scheme, the journey completed by a car is also sustainable if the car completes the journey before the tank is empty ( t , t max ) and Ccar , C max .\nOther indirect consequences come out of this example. Theoretically, the 'clean' bike trip can negatively impact the environment. Prior to the trip, the bicyclist might be inclined to eat an apple for energy and therefore indirectly supports an apple farmer. A truck driver who is transporting the apple to the market is also supported by this activity, albeit marginally. The truck consequently contributes to the emission load. Therefore, secondary environmental costs that are not usually foreseen when riding a bike might be taken into account. To be thorough, we should not stop here; we should include the manufacturing costs needed to build the truck, bike, or car. We should also include the impact from the exhaust of all the commuters who journeyed to and from the factory to build the bike, car, or truck. The list would go on and on and the problem\nTable 3 | Eight possibilities for sustainable (S) or unsustainable (US) activities\n\nUS US US US US US, Level(s).Level(s) = single single.

S/US, Level(s).Level(s) = multiple. S/US, Duration.t , t max = yes. S/US, Cost.C , C max = yes\nquickly becomes an intractable one to assess. Although arguably small, the ramifications of activities should be considered. To a degree, these are reminiscent of the Life Cycle Assessment considerations of the 'cradle-to-grave' analysis and Boundary Critique issues 45 associated with typical rigid boundaries of problems. The model should be expandable to account for these issues by adding 'higher-order terms'. The question of how these terms are weighted is probably less important than being consistent. (See Appendix item Generalizing the activity to include higher-order dependencies.)\nOne method to determine the higher-order terms in this case would be using the fraction of the weight of the one apple eaten compared to the weight of the entire lot on the truck. This information might be very difficult to ascertain and statistical models would be needed. The number of linked activities or levels N or the number of higher-order considerations will each have to be determined in light of the knowledge and uncertainty of the problem. When the higher-order term is sufficiently uncertain, the calculation should then stop.\nNow consider two sets of capacities, renewables V r and nonrenewables V nr , as given in Figure 1,\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n/C8\n/C9\n/C8\n/C9\nc 1 1 , c 2 11 , c 4 1121 , c 4 1122 [ V nr , c 3 111 , c 5 11221 , c 3 112 [ V r , and as an example, an 'actual' situation, c 3 111 , c 4 1121 , c 5 11221 , c 2 12 /C8 /C9 [ V /C3 , V /C3 ( V nr | V nr . Using the capacities c r and c nr and current levels c r (0), c nr (0),\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere f nr ( t ) and f r ( t ) are representative growth or decay functions for renewables and non-renewables and from Eq. 19,\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nThis example represents, among many others, a mixed resources problem with uniform evolution functions for renewable and nonrenewable resources. Though the demand in this example is constant, it could be time dependent and therefore represents a national transportation activity. Scenarios developing replacement technologies (fuel cells) using renewable energies (solar, wind, etc.), for the most part, have not yet been developed on large scales, and therefore, the uncertainty of replaceable technologies limits the knowledge for substitution. Not surprisingly, this important demand is considered unsustainable and, subsequently, is a major area of concern and requires ongoing development and research.\nApart from the previously mentioned energy, transportation and ecological applications, other prime domains include agriculture, business, and architecture, and these can also be addressed with the model. A number of parameters and concepts can directly address the general definitions. Sustainable agriculture, for example, is characterized by a number of requirements and can be met by the framework developed here. These include:\n1. Satisfying human food and fiber needs (activities meeting a demand, Eqs. 18, 19).\n2. Enhancing environmental quality and the natural resource based upon the agricultural economy (reducing I and therefore CE , Eqs. 4-6).\n3.

In the absence of well-defined analytic constructs such as the higher-order terms and social costs, social scientists will have difficulty connecting the local and global in an analytic way. We also note similar activities may have similar costs, and in this case a simplification could be made, e.g. CE 5 CE , i for i representing two or more activities. Theys recommends a multi-tier system to address these separate social issues, similar to the indirect (higher-order) terms considered here.\nBeyond this concern, connecting the social to the other dimensions is still problematic. An important study in the late 1990s was conducted by the Dutch Ministry of the Environment with the aim of gaining knowledge on the environmental and social interactions. A set of indicators was used to build an operational linkage between the social and environmental dimensions. As suspected, the study found that in some cases, social policies (e.g., reinforcement of consumption) were determined to adversely affect the environment (e.g., loss in eco-efficiency) 15,47 . The study concluded that in the absence of economic indicators, the model was too rudimentary to represent the complex interactions and causal relations between social and environmental indicators 15 . It was concluded that a holistic framework 47 encompassing the three dimensions was still needed but that treatment of the social-environmental interaction was most easily handled, as previously mentioned, at the local level 46 . Translated to the approach presented here, the local or base activity , 5 1 is where social issues become more concrete. Perhaps consensus at the local level is one way to proceed. On the other hand, consensus of social costs on the global level, although more difficult, presents more noble ambitions in terms of tackling the issues of sustainability.\nAs noted earlier, a good model should be 'falsifiable' to the criteria it was meant to test; clearly some examples in the economic and environmental dimension are more readily testable than in the social dimension. Indeed, a proper balance must be achieved when providing numbers for costs, durations and substitutable activities, when knowledge permits. Only when these figures with their respective levels of uncertainty are tabulated can a full validation be determined.\nAlthough numbers are not given here, Table 4 does provide a starting point in response to the not-so-quantifiable theoretical issues of sustainability. The terms CF , CE , CS , C , t F , t E , t S , t , the characterization of the activity A , and the possibility of substitution S indicates where the model could respond.\nThe model can be used to provide a response function for activities that use a mix of renewable and non-renewable resources. Any attempt to model these functions must consider the uncertainties in the dynamics of the demand and resources available, both for the present and the future.\nFinally, we conclude that there is no panacea for solving all of the issues. Though the economic values can be determined from markets and environmental costs from measurements and models, the social costs will continue to be difficult to pin down. We observe from Table 1 the terms 'balance', 'restrictions', 'maintaining', 'controlling', 'integrating', 'preventing' are difficult to quantify. Some social issues, e.g., Socio-Biological, do not lend themselves easily to a quantitative model while others, e.g., Ecological Engineering, involving ecological resilience, do.
