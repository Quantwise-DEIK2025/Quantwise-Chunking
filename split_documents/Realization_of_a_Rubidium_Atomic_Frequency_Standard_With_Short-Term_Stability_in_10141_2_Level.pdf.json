It operates as a frequency-locked loop, utilizing the PP as an atomic frequency discriminator. The reference frequency of the PP is 6.835 GHz, corresponding to the frequency of the transition between hyperfine levels F = 2 and mF = 0 and F = 1 and mF = 0 of the ground state 5S1 / 2 of the 87 Rb atom. The transition is also called clock transition. Normally, a 10-MHz voltage-controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO) is used as a local oscillator (LO). The synthesizer converts the 10-MHz signal of the VCXO to a frequency-modulated 6.835-GHz microwave with modulation frequency fM . The microwave is applied to the PP to interrogate the rubidium clock transition, creating the discrimination signal. After being amplified by the preamplifier (PreAMP), the discrimination signal goes to the phase sensitive detector (PSD) for demodulation, then enters the integrator for filtering and dc amplifying, and finally is transformed into the correction voltage signal to control the frequency of the VCXO, realizing locking of the whole loop.\nThe SNR of the discrimination signal strongly affects frequency stability which is the key performance of the RAFS. Since the discrimination signal is stimulated by the interrogation microwave provided by the synthesizer, the frequency stability is also influenced by the noise of the microwave. Research showed that the phase noise of the interrogation microwave at 2 nfM will deteriorate the frequency stability through the intermodulation effect of the locking loop [10]. In addition, the frequency stability is affected by environmental effects of rubidium atoms. The effects originate from the sensitivity of the atomic transition frequency to fluctuations of various environmental parameters, such as temperature, magnetic field, microwave power, light intensity, barometric pressure, and so on. Taking all the three factors into account, Allan deviation frequency stability of an RAFS can be written as [6]\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere τ is the averaging time and\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nFig. 2.

The first one σ SNR (τ) is SNR limited stability [11], determined by the noise power spectral density SN and the discrimination slope KD that measures the signal intensity, where SN = 2 eI 0 with e being the electron charge and I 0, the shot noise current [11]. The second one σ PN (τ) is the phase noise limited stability, determined by S φ( 2 nfM ) , the single sideband power spectral density of the phase noise of the interrogation microwave at 2 nfM ( C 2 n is a constant related to the modulation frequency fM and the carrier frequency been modulated). In the calculation of σ PN (τ) by using (3), one usually considers only the contribution of the n = 1 term, since the contributions of high-order terms are very small [10].

Rubidium atoms are first optically pumped by using a rubidium spectral lamp to create population reversion between two clock transition energy levels. Interrogation microwave is then applied to rubidium atoms to stimulate the clock transition. The SNR of the discrimination signal is determined by the characteristics of the PP.\nThe PP used is schematically shown in Fig. 2. A 87 Rb spectral lamp with Xe as starter gas was utilized as the source of pumping light. As shown by Hao et al. [12], this\nFig. 3. (a) Slotted tube and (b) entrance cap of the slotted tube microwave cavity.\nkind of spectral lump could output intense rubidium D1 and D2 line lights with narrow linewidth. After being collimated by the lens, the light is filtered by the 85 Rb filter cell to eliminate the a components in D1 and D2 lines and then filtered by a bandpass optical filter with a center wavelength of 786 nm and bandwidth of 22 nm to eliminate the light emitted by starter gas. This choice of light source and the double-filtering scheme enables to enhance pumping efficiency and meanwhile to reduce the noise of atomic signal. The filtered light then goes to the absorption cell inside a slotted tube microwave cavity composed of a slotted tube, a cylinder, an entrance cap, and an end cap. The absorption cell, with a diameter of 40 mm, contains 87 Rb vapor and mixed buffer gases of Ar and N2. Both the filter cell and the absorption cell were heated and temperature-controlled at appropriate temperatures to create stable and useful rubidium vapors. A modulated 6.835-GHz microwave is electrically coupled into the cavity to interrogate the clock transition of rubidium vapor atoms in the absorption cell. The photocell was used to detect the intensity of the transmitted light through the absorption cell, which varies when the atomic clock transition takes place. A Helmholtz coil produces a uniform C field to define quantization axis for atomic transition. Three layers of magnetic shield were employed to reduce the disturbance of environmental magnetic field, two of which were installed on the PP.\nThe slotted tube cavity is a nonstandard microwave cavity we developed nearly two decades ago [13]. The crucial component of the cavity is a slotted tube, whose structural parameters play main role in determining the resonance frequency and mode of the cavity [14]. An obvious advantage of the cavity over the commonly used standard TE111 and TE011 cavities is that its size could be flexibly designed. This property enables to use large size absorption cell to enhance the atomic signal SNR. Actually, a series of cavities with different sizes have been developed in our laboratory [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. In this work, we used the cavity with an inner diameter of 40 mm, the largest one we have designed so far. The structure of the slotted tube is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 also shows the structure of the entrance cap of the cavity, which is needed for a large size slotted tube cavity. The central grid structure of the cap is used to eliminate RF disturbance from outside to resonance mode of the cavity and let pumping light pass through. The entrance cap also acts as an optical aperture to collimate the pumping light into a light beam with a diameter of 32 mm, slightly smaller than that of the absorption cell.\nFig. 4. Zeeman transition spectrum of hyperfine sublevels in ground state of 87 Rb atoms. Totally, nine Zeeman transitions were observed. Peak 4 at the center is the clock transition. Peaks 3 and 5 compose of two transitions each.\nFor high-performance RAFS design, the microwave distribution inside the cavity is extremely important since the clock transition can be excited only by the magnetic microwave field parallel to the quantization axis. The parallelism property is described quantitatively by ξ , the field orientation factor defined as [15]\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere V defines the volume of interaction region of atoms and microwave, Hz is the magnetic microwave field parallel to quantization axis, and H is the total field. ξ could be obtained by measuring the Zeeman transition spectrum of 87 Rb vapor atoms. The experimentally measured spectrum for the used PP is shown in Fig. 4. Based on the spectrum, ξ could be simply calculated through the relation [16]\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere I 3 (υ) , I 4 (υ) , and I 5 (υ) are the transition intensity distributions of the central three transitions. The finally obtained ξ for the used cavity is 0.82. We believe that it is much higher than those of the traditional standard cavities.\nThe SNR limited stability σ SNR ( τ) of the PP was estimated. First, the light path and the working temperatures of the absorption cell, the filter cell, and the lamp bulb were optimized for maximum discrimination slope Kd . The optimal temperatures were found to be 68 ◦ C, 93 ◦ C, and 109 ◦ C, respectively. In this condition, the shot noise current I 0, i.e., background current of the photocell, was then measured to be 211 μ A, and corresponding noise power spectral density SN was calculated to be 8.2 pA/Hz 1 / 2 . Fig. 5 shows the measured frequency discrimination curve of the RAFS. Kd , the slope of the central part of the curve, was calculated to be 18.0 nA/Hz. By using (2), σ SNR ( τ) was estimated to be 4.7 × 10 -14 τ -1 / 2 , implying that the PP enables to realize a stability in medium 10 -14 τ -1 / 2 level.\nFig. 5.

The experimentally measured spectrum for the used PP is shown in Fig. 4. Based on the spectrum, ξ could be simply calculated through the relation [16]\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere I 3 (υ) , I 4 (υ) , and I 5 (υ) are the transition intensity distributions of the central three transitions. The finally obtained ξ for the used cavity is 0.82. We believe that it is much higher than those of the traditional standard cavities.\nThe SNR limited stability σ SNR ( τ) of the PP was estimated. First, the light path and the working temperatures of the absorption cell, the filter cell, and the lamp bulb were optimized for maximum discrimination slope Kd . The optimal temperatures were found to be 68 ◦ C, 93 ◦ C, and 109 ◦ C, respectively. In this condition, the shot noise current I 0, i.e., background current of the photocell, was then measured to be 211 μ A, and corresponding noise power spectral density SN was calculated to be 8.2 pA/Hz 1 / 2 . Fig. 5 shows the measured frequency discrimination curve of the RAFS. Kd , the slope of the central part of the curve, was calculated to be 18.0 nA/Hz. By using (2), σ SNR ( τ) was estimated to be 4.7 × 10 -14 τ -1 / 2 , implying that the PP enables to realize a stability in medium 10 -14 τ -1 / 2 level.\nFig. 5.

The interrogation microwave originates from a 10-MHz LO with a stability of 1 × 10 -12 at 1 s. The 100-MHz frequency of the oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO) with near-end phase noise of -153 dBc/Hz at 2 fM (here fM = 136 Hz) is phase-locked to that of the LO through phase detector PD1. Due to the 30-Hz bandwidth of the locking loop, the locked 100-MHz signal is of stability of the LO and the near-end phase noise of the OCXO. For ensuring low phase noise and high spectral purity of the 6.835-GHz microwave, two dielectric resonator oscillators (DROs) with low far-end phase noise are employed, of which DRO1 resonates at 6.80 GHz and DRO2 resonates at 6.835 GHz. The 6.80-GHz frequency of the DRO1 is phase-locked directly to the 100 MHz through PD2. In order to lock the 6.835 GHz of the DRO2 to the 100 MHz also, the frequencies of DRO1 and DRO2 are mixed in the double-balanced mixer (DBM), creating a 35-MHz signal. After being filtered by the low-pass filter (LPF), the 35-MHz signal is phase compared in PD3 with the 35-MHz signal produced by the direct digital synthesizer (DDS) from the 100-MHz signal. The phase comparison signal is then used to control the 6.835-GHz frequency of the DRO2. The finally obtained 6.835-GHz microwave has near-end phase noise property determined by the OCXO, far-end phase noise property determined by the DRO2, and short-term stability property determined by the LO.\nThe modulation of the 6.835-GHz microwave is realized by modulating the 35-MHz signal of the DDS. The modulation\nFig. 7. Spectrum of the 6.835-GHz interrogation microwave.\nFig. 8. Phase noise measurement result of the 6.835-GHz microwave.\nsignal is a 136-Hz square wave. The modulated 6.835-GHz microwave is coupled to the PP to interrogate the clock transition of the rubidium atoms.\nThe interrogation microwave obtained this way is of high spectral purity. As shown in Fig. 7, the output microwave contains only the 6.835-GHz component, and no obvious harmonic or spurious components are observed in a 500-MHz range nearby. In this case, automatic-level control (ALC) of the microwave power will be more efficient since there is less influence of harmonic or spurious components. The stabilization of the microwave power helps to reduce the microwave power shift of the clock transition.\nThe phase noise of the 6.835-GHz microwave was measured, and the result is shown in Fig. 8. It can be found from Fig. 8 that the phase noise of the microwave at 2 fM (272 Hz) is about -110dBc/Hz. Based on this result and by using (4), the phase noise limited stability σ PN (τ) of the RAFS is estimated to be 6.0 × 10 -14 τ -1 / 2 .",

The coefficient was experimentally measured to be 7 × 10 -15 /Pa. The RAFS was then taken back to the open air environment and the barometric pressure fluctuation was monitored. The barometric pressure was recorded once every 10 s in a period of 50 000 s. Based on the fluctuation data and the obtained frequency shift coefficient, the influence of the barometric effect to stability of the RAFS was calculated by using (4), and the result is shown as the upper line in Fig. 9.

To reduce the barometric effect, a sealed box was designed and used to envelop the PP to isolate it from barometric environment. The resulted influence of the barometric effect is shown as the lower line in Fig. 9. It can be seen that the influence is reduced by nearly one order of magnitude. The barometric effect originates essentially from the buffer gas pressure effect inside the absorption cell [17].
