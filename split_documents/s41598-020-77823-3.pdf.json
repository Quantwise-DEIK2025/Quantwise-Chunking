It outperforms alternative models by incorporating network connectivity and demonstrates the importance of textual networks in improving predictive power and semantic interpretability.\n\nYi Li, Zichuan Mi & Wenjun Jing *\nThis study adopts the textual network to describe the coordination among the interplay of words, where nodes represent words and nodes are connected if the corresponding words have co-occurrence pattern across documents. To study stock movements, we further proposed the sparse laplacian shrinkage logistic model (SLS_L) which can properly take into account the network connectivity structure. By using this approach, we investigated the relationship between Shenwan index and analysts' research reports. The securities analysts' research reports are crawled by a famous financial website in China: EastMoney, and are then parsed into time-series textual data. The empirical results show that the proposed SLS_L model outperforms alternatives including Lasso-Logistics (L_L) and MCP-Logistic (MCP_L) models by having better prediction performance. Besides, we search published literature and find the identified keywords with more lucid interpretations. Our study unveils some interesting findings that the efficient use of textual network is important to improve the predictive power as well as the semantic interpretability in stock market analysis.\nIn the financial markets, the exponential increase in the amount and types of data available to investors prompted some companies to completely change their business strategy and adopt a Big Data investment framework. With the advent of social networking sites, like Facebook, Blog, Twitter, etc., the latest information about public opinions has become abundant. In fact, investigating stock market by using online financial textual data has attracted increasing attention in academic and real-life business 1-3 . Some early empirical research in behavioral finance argued that investment decisions are subject to the effect of investor sentiment 4,5 . Such inference was further confirmed by the studies of Li 6 and Schumaker et al. 7 . The researchers discovered that emotion from online social media can be explored for the stock market trend, e.g. whether the stock price is going up or down according to the news media affects investor confidence with a delay of at least one month 8 . However, when encountering the sheer volume of online resources on various websites, users find it very difficult to distinguish between posts containing facts, rumours, guesses, and fake news. The effects of imperfect information make investors unable to attract the stock market reactions accurately.\nNowadays, increasing numbers of studies quantitatively examine the information percolation of research reports on stocks 8,9 . One of the earliest studies, by Previts et al. 10 , argued that the analyst reports are of great importance to investors' information needs. Asquith, Mikhail, and Au 11 then discovered that the argument of the downgrade reports has a positive relationship with the stock market reaction. Twedt and Rees 12 further investigated the effect of reports, finding that stocks could be positively correlated with the textual tone of the reports.

Compared to English, Chinese is more complicated in terms of recognition, segmentation and analysis 13 : Chinese does not have an explicit word boundary marker and do not contain whitespace between words; Chinese words are not clearly marked grammatically; Chinese also contains a very large number of homophones in sentences 14 . Hence, the amount of research on Chinese social media analysis is limited and the number of research articles on using the textual analysis results to predict the stock market in China is even lower. Fortunately, more researchers have started to conduct Chinese textual analysis in the recent years.

The fundamental idea of our multi-variable classification method is that related vectors of numeric feature values originate from words of documents in stock prediction. The classic logistic regression model has long been regarded as allowing highly accurate prediction as well with feature interpretability of a probabilistic nature. However, there are some challenges when performing logistic regression model on text mining. The first challenge is 'curse of dimensionality' due to the massive amounts of words. Generally, a document collection contains thousands of words, and a bag of words representation of a document will probably have a very high dimensionality. Furthermore, a sparse matrix is created in order to indicate which document each word occurs in. The matrix is sparse because most words occur just in a few documents. A large number of penalized regression approaches are proposed, including sparse penalty and thereby breaking the curse of dimensionality to improve model interpretability 16-20 . Such proposals are the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), elastic net, the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), the minimax concave penalty (MCP) and others. Among these methods, MCP has been demonstrated the preferred performance on the selection of predictors and computational efficiency 21,22 .\nThe second challenge is the insufficiently independent words as the individual unit of text mining, which have usually been used to express the semantics of the document. The pioneering study shows that the text's semantics exist inherent interplay of words, analyses their interconnections, distinguishes \"signal from noise\" and provides a more comprehensive description of the document 1 . For example, if the size of a laptop is described as a word \"thin\", then it is considered as a positive thing, whereas if the sentence contains \"thin\" relative to the weight of an individual then it is considered as a negative statement. By uncovering these latent relations between words, the meanings of words can be derived. From the perspective of each single relationship and then extend that perspective to the whole text network, each word represents a node. Links between nodes denote that the corresponding words are semantically \"correlated\". This network structure can be done by one individual who can provide personal meaning to the events, or meaning can also be provided at the supra-individual level. In the latter case, words with a high connectivity are more likely to be involved in an important semantic process. Hence, semantic relations between words can be constructed for whole text network analysis. Incorporation the latent structure information has been proved to significantly improve predictive power. Li et al. 23 proposed a network-constrained regularization method and found that it facilitates the selection of predictors using the network information. However, as far as we known, none of the previous network-based analyses have been trained on the background of text predictive procedures, which is the focus of this paper.\nThe main goal of this work is to combine the text network in forecasting stock market and thus be more informative. To this end, we study network-constrained sparse logistic regression, which has exploited a new perspective for the research and application of text mining. Firstly, we have constructed the textual co-occurrence network, and studied its properties. Then the composite penalization is presented. This method is built upon a combination of the minimax concave penalty and the Laplacian penalty in order to achieve the properties of sparsity and smoothness 24 . In particular, Laplacian penalty takes full advantage of the existing network information to smooth the differences between coefficients of tightly connected words, aiming at improving prediction performance. Our work fills the gap in incorporating textual network into forecasting stock market, and undergirds the important conclusion that with some delay word patterns in security analysts' research reports affect the weekly Shenwan Stock closing index of the real estate sector.

Suppose that the stock market movement is Y = { y 1, . . . , yt , . . . , yn } , where yt denotes an observation of categorical response variable at time t , which indicates the fluctuation direction in terms of increase ( ↑ ) or decrease ( ↓ ). There exists a market predictor set T = { T 1, . . . , Tt , . . . , Tn } where Tt represents the textual data available at time t , and n is the size of observations. The term xi , t extracted from the text Tt is the frequency count. Thus, the textual data Tt is defined as a word vector X t = x 1, t , . . . , xi , t , . . . , xm , t , where m is the number of vocabularies.\n{ } One assumption here is that the text Xt -1 could deliver underlying information about the future market and the ability to forecast stock movement y t . Assuming that y t follows a binomial distribution, a binomial logit model is defined by\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere β is the vector of regression coefficients, whose length is the vocabulary size m . Therefore, the objective function of logistic regression can be written as\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nConstruction of text networks. In text network analysis, a vertex corresponds to a word. Links between words can be regarded as meaningful information in sentences. Furthermore, our study assumes that the meanings of words embodied in a text could be modelled as a network of linked words. That is, this type of information about nodes, along with the links between them, should be used for uncovering, understanding, and exploiting the semantics of text as a whole.\nConsider an undirected co-occurrence network represented by a weighted graph G = ( V, E , W ) with vertex set V = { 1, . . . , m } corresponding to m keywords, edge set E = {( i , j ) : ( i , j ) ∈ V × V } , the degree set D = diag ( d1, d2, . . . , d m ) , where d m is the degree of vertex m , and the set of weights W = { α i , j : ( i , j ) ∈ E } . Here α i,j is the weight of edge ( i, j ), which measures the strength of connection between keyword vectors i and j , with 1 for complete-link and 0 for no-link, defined by\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere ˆ ri , j is the Pearson correlation coefficient, and r is the threshold parameter based on the p -value for determining the significance between keyword vectors i and j . There are other quantitative measurements of defining the correlation methods, including the Euclidean distance, Spearman's correlation, power adjacency function, and so on (Huang et al. 2011). In this paper, we only consider the Pearson correlation. Finally, we construct the adjacency matrix A = ( α i , j , 1 ≤ i , j ≤ m ), which is used for the Laplacian penalty related to the network, as we illustrate below. ∣ ∣\nSparse Laplacian shrinkage.

Hence, the first penalty promotes sparsity and directs the search to more meaningful item combinations.\nFor network penalty, the Laplacian penalty is adopted in the second penalty term, defined as /afii9838 2 β ′ L β . The Laplacian matrix L is always positive semi-definite and defined with respect to the network G , with L = D-A, which satisfies\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nIt accommodates the network structure. For instance, items with higher connectivity are considered to have closely related semantic units. We adopt a constraint on the contrast between β j and β k to improve the smoothness of estimated coefficients with respect to the prior structure information and thus results in more interpretable identification of the items.\nThe prediction procedure follows the stock movement prediction method described in the work of Bergmeir and Benitez 25 . In particular, the SLS method has three tuning parameters: (λ 1 , λ 2 and γ). The parameter λ 1 controls the level of sparsity, λ 2 controls the degree of the coefficient smoothing, and the third parameter γ in addition to λ 1 , governs the concavity of the sparsity penalty function. In practice, we search in a grid of λ 1 , λ 2 values with λ 2 ∈ (0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10) and choose the values of λ 1 , λ 2 that maximize accuracy of predictions. The third parameter γ controls the concavity of the MCP penalty. When γ →∞ , MCP reduces to the L 1 penalty. In practice, we fix γ to the default value of 2.7 to reduce computation, and the prediction accuracy is usually not sensitive to γ values.\nTo be more specific, we adopt V-fold cross-validation to choose the optimal combination of λ 1 and λ 2 , and then partition the dataset into separate training and test data. Furthermore, variable selection and parameter estimation are accomplished on the training data with cross-validation to choose the tuning parameters, and the test data is used to assess the forecasting abilities. The accuracy of predictions is defined as the area under the curve (AUC), which can be defined as the probability that a randomly chosen positive instance is ranked higher than a randomly chosen negative instance.

        "text": "Provides a detailed methodology for stock market prediction using textual data from analyst reports, including data collection, text segmentation, keyword extraction, and network construction.\n\nExperimental design. Our paper relates to research that the power of information on securities analysts' research reports and applies an SLS_L model to predict the stock market reaction. The flow of our method has some of the components depicted in Fig. 1. Our overall processor provides a solid basis to determine the internal connections between securities analysts' online research reports and stock price movements. At one end textual data obtained from online sources and stock index are fed as input to the system and at the other end, some stock predictive movements are generated as output. The first step is data collection using the web crawler, and then extracting relevant information from a suitable dataset. Words and phrases that signal a stock movement are important and should be extracted. Thus, the preprocessor is a crucial part of text mining and is mainly composed of the following common preparatory steps: dictionary building, word segmentation, and word cleaning. After data cleaning, we measure the time difference between each word and target indicator, and then choose the list of words that indicate the most significant correlation, in a sense that the subset is as small as possible but still retains all the relevant information.\nIn statistical terminology, a word is an observed variable, and a document is a list of observed variables representing an instance. Clearly, the list of words used the text representation are retrieved from the message corpus based on actual occurrences of the words. Building on the network construction, we examine important network properties such as density, centrality and K-core. At the subsequent step, we predict market movement direction using sparse group Laplacian shrinkage logistic model and assign weights based on text network information to keywords in proportion to the market movement. The remaining keywords serve as a determinate variable in our prediction model. Each step will be elaborated on Fig. 1.\nData descriptions. For the stock market, the weekly Stock closing index of the real estate sector from the Shenwan Research database (SWS, searc h.com/EN/) has been collected ranging from May 14, 2015 to September 18, 2017 28,29 . The overall data includes 108 trading weeks. The sample of stocks being studied are 136 firms that together made up the weekly SWS index of real estate sector. The prediction target in this paper is the performance of the stock movement. The Stock closing index of the real estate sector is labelled suitably using a simple method. If the stock index at time t is larger than that at time t -1 , the direction at time t is 1, otherwise, direction at time t is 0, that is, the stock movement performance is mapped into 0 or 1 as the prediction target.\nThe textual data are collected by crawling and parsing large amounts of web pages about the most popular and prestigious financial website in China, EastMoney ( oney.com/), by searching the content of all securities analysts' research reports in the China real estate sector from 14 May 2015 to 18 Sep. 2017. The online reports are to give a complete and timely description of stock information from the security company, which will dynamically capture the stock trend, hence assist the user to make an investment decision 30,31 . We crawl down and compile from the Internet using Python libraries, which are composed of two major libraries: the target URL list generating library (Requests) and the HTML page parsing library (Beautiful Soup).\nFor each research report in the China real estate sector on the site, the script recorded the date of the posting, the title, the security company name and the body of the message. The text of a report includes varying levels of topics, such as the company's significant recent developments, industry dynamics, a critique of the company's management and board, and investment risk, etc. There are a total of 2082 reports from 65 security companies. Each research report is timed to the day, the mean security reports in a day are 3.8 and the number of words in a report is most frequently between 500 and 2000. In order to assess the content of the research report, we employ\nwell-established text mining, which is executed to transform raw documents into lists of keyword vectors and adjacent matrix of the network.\nPredictive keyword vector extraction. The research report is employed as our textual source, mainly because these texts might expose some things that firms may not like to tell their outside listeners in blunt terms. By implementing this action, the raw text of a report published in the same week is merged into one document, where larger reports have adequate data distribution within a week's span. After eliminating noise and outliers, our research reports are narrowed down to 108 windows over the 28 months and the mean security reports in a window are 17, with a maximum of 36. Each window is converted into the bag of words, represented as a vector of counts. The following steps are conducted on a single document. Our judgment and cleaning criterion is elaborated on as follow.\nStep 1: dictionary building. The Sogou Pinyin input method is a dominant input software in China, and Sogou cell lexicon can be obtained from the Sogou Pinyin input method official website ( ://pinyi n.sogou .com/ dict/). These lexica come from the analysis of millions of Chinese web pages generated by the Sogou search engine 32 . Therefore, we choose the Sogou cell lexicon as the dictionary and exclude the uncommonly used words. Then we own the remaining 63,320 words or phrases as the external dictionary, which is embedded in step 2 in order to decrease ambiguities.\nStep 2: Text segmentation. Unlike English where text processing starts with tokenization, Chinese text segmentation is the procedure of identifying the boundaries between semantic units, for instance, phrases or words. In this step, we use the Jieba package to perform text segmentation 33 . This segmentation approach is mainly based on a Hidden Markov model, and adding our own custom dictionary obtained from step 1 can ensure a higher rate of correct segmentation. To discern words, the Viterbi algorithm used in this package is to find the maximum tangential points based on the word frequency 34 .\nStep 3: words cleaning. Since stop words do not contribute to the analysis in textual data without dependency on a particular topic, we remove these words with the same roots appearing in the stop-list such as numbers, more white spaces, tabs, punctuation characters, stop words, etc. In addition, we build stop-list that contains 75 non-semantic words such as \" 是 (is)\", \" 的 (of)\", \" 关于 (about)\", \" 如何 (how)\", and so on. We remove a word with a proportion in all documents was smaller than 80% because the chi-squares statistics is known not to be reliable for the low-frequency terms.\nUsing the above step 1-step 3, an initial set of 3285 keywords was built.\nStep 4: keyword vector selection. There are thousands of words in documents. If we choose all words as features, it will be impossible to do forecasting since the computer cannot process such enormous amounts of data. Thus, we need to choose the most meaningful and representative units for prediction. There are very popular selection methods, for instance, chi-square statistics 35 , information gain, mutual information, document frequency and latent semantic analysis 36 . In this paper, we use chi-square ( χ 2 ) independent statistics to test the frequency count of each item in each report data and the market indicator fluctuations measured in terms of increase ( ↑ ) or decrease ( ↓ ) during each time period of one week. The statistic test is compared to the chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom. After the above filtering, 56 words remained at the 5% significance level in our trial. We concluded that the 56 words provide sufficient evidence to determine that there is an association between the nature of the frequency items and the market fluctuations. Therefore, we directly put the 56-word count vectors as the most predictive variable into the construction of the network and the predicted model.",
        "original_text": "Experimental design. Our paper relates to research that the power of information on securities analysts' research reports and applies an SLS_L model to predict the stock market reaction. The flow of our method has some of the components depicted in Fig. 1. Our overall processor provides a solid basis to determine the internal connections between securities analysts' online research reports and stock price movements. At one end textual data obtained from online sources and stock index are fed as input to the system and at the other end, some stock predictive movements are generated as output. The first step is data collection using the web crawler, and then extracting relevant information from a suitable dataset. Words and phrases that signal a stock movement are important and should be extracted. Thus, the preprocessor is a crucial part of text mining and is mainly composed of the following common preparatory steps: dictionary building, word segmentation, and word cleaning. After data cleaning, we measure the time difference between each word and target indicator, and then choose the list of words that indicate the most significant correlation, in a sense that the subset is as small as possible but still retains all the relevant information.\nIn statistical terminology, a word is an observed variable, and a document is a list of observed variables representing an instance. Clearly, the list of words used the text representation are retrieved from the message corpus based on actual occurrences of the words. Building on the network construction, we examine important network properties such as density, centrality and K-core. At the subsequent step, we predict market movement direction using sparse group Laplacian shrinkage logistic model and assign weights based on text network information to keywords in proportion to the market movement. The remaining keywords serve as a determinate variable in our prediction model. Each step will be elaborated on Fig. 1.\nData descriptions. For the stock market, the weekly Stock closing index of the real estate sector from the Shenwan Research database (SWS, searc h.com/EN/) has been collected ranging from May 14, 2015 to September 18, 2017 28,29 . The overall data includes 108 trading weeks. The sample of stocks being studied are 136 firms that together made up the weekly SWS index of real estate sector. The prediction target in this paper is the performance of the stock movement. The Stock closing index of the real estate sector is labelled suitably using a simple method. If the stock index at time t is larger than that at time t -1 , the direction at time t is 1, otherwise, direction at time t is 0, that is, the stock movement performance is mapped into 0 or 1 as the prediction target.\nThe textual data are collected by crawling and parsing large amounts of web pages about the most popular and prestigious financial website in China, EastMoney ( oney.com/), by searching the content of all securities analysts' research reports in the China real estate sector from 14 May 2015 to 18 Sep. 2017. The online reports are to give a complete and timely description of stock information from the security company, which will dynamically capture the stock trend, hence assist the user to make an investment decision 30,31 . We crawl down and compile from the Internet using Python libraries, which are composed of two major libraries: the target URL list generating library (Requests) and the HTML page parsing library (Beautiful Soup).\nFor each research report in the China real estate sector on the site, the script recorded the date of the posting, the title, the security company name and the body of the message.

Keywords network. ( a ) The simple grid layout of a graph; ( b ) the node is scaled using the Fruchterman-Reingold layout algorithm.\nresult is significantly affected by the fact that text network of research reports on stocks is loos knit instead of densely connected.\nCentrality is an indicator to find the most important keywords within a network. Betweenness is a centrality measure of a node within a network. Specifically, betweenness centrality measures the number of times a vertex acts as a link along the shortest path between two other nodes. A vertex with high betweenness has a high probability to control the flow of information in the network. In our study, only 44 vertices of the betweenness centrality are greater than zero. The word \"Short Term\" is the most influential keywords, with a betweenness centrality of 287.89, followed by \"Pessimistic\", \"Input Market\", \"Larger\" and \"Market\". The word \"Short Term\" takes up a position in the centre of the network and has a great effect on other words in the text network, which suggests that the factor like \"Short Term\" plays an important role in the interactivity of the stock market and the real estate market. This is because that our work focuses mainly on stock price reactions in the short term.\nK-core is an indicator to identify closely interlinked subgroup within a network, which indicates a coalition of many keywords who have many stable patterns with each other. A K-core measure is used to find whether the network is structured. Table 1 shows that the cores become more interlinked when k increases from zero, which indicates that our text network has a structural property rather than random 38 .\nTable 1. Results of the K-core collapse sequence analysis.\n\nk-core, 1 = 0. k-core, 2 = 1. k-core, 3 = 2. k-core, 4 = 3. k-core, 5 = 4. k-core, 6 = 5. k-core, 7 = 6. k-core, 8 = 7. k-core, 9 = 8. k-core, 10 = 9. k-core, 11 = 10. k-remainder, 1 = 5. k-remainder, 2 = 3. k-remainder, 3 = 7. k-remainder, 4 = 3. k-remainder, 5 = 5. k-remainder, 6 = 3. k-remainder, 7 = 3. k-remainder, 8 = 5. k-remainder, 9 = 3. k-remainder, 10 = 1. k-remainder, 11 = 18\nPrediction results. One simple hypothesis about the validity of a text network is that the text network is very noisy if the stock movement can be forecasted well using textual data only. In this instance, textual data seem to be sufficient to forecast. At the same time, integration of the network structure may not increase the accuracy of prediction much. On the contrary, if the prediction accuracy in the SLS_L model is improved, the use of network information could be more effective.\nTo test the above hypothesis, we conduct an evaluation of prediction performance using threefold crossvalidation. For each fixed /afii9838 2 , we can obtain the second tuning parameter besides /afii9838 2 by using the number of steps for the MCP optimal solution. The prediction results for the proposed Sparse Laplacian Shrinkage-Logistic (SLS_L) model based on 5 replicates are calculated as AUC = 0.9360, /afii9838 1 = 0.0251, /afii9838 2 = 0.001. Given these descriptive results, /afii9838 1 performs the variable selection and control the level of sparsity, and /afii9838 2 controls the degree of the coefficient smoothing, that is, the similarity between coefficients. When /afii9838 2 is around zero, the network structure is very noisy. In our study, the values of the tuning parameter /afii9838 2 are non-zero in all replicates. This illustrates the prediction accuracy of SLS_L model, which seems to perform better as it uses the network information.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of network information from another point of view, Lasso-Logistics (L_L) and MCP-Logistic (MCP_L) models are applied to assess the prediction accuracy of the proposed SLS_L model. These comparisons of results demonstrate that the proposed SLS_L model (AUC = 0.9360) has the highest AUC in comparison with L_L(AUC = 0.8344) and MCP_L(AUC = 0.8707). The AUC values conclude that the proposed method can achieve lower prediction errors and higher prediction accuracy in the stock direction of change and outperforms L_L and MCP_L models in predicting the SWS week index of real estate sector. It provides evidence of the advantage of appending the network penalty and smoothing over the similarity between words.\nIn addition, the impact of the time lag on the market reaction is considered in this work. The up and down of the stock price is predicated on the subsequent n weeks (five trading days). The results of the experiment show that in general, the AUC on the next one week was the highest, yielding up to 0.9360 for the SWS index of real estate sector. In the similar result, Asquith et al. 11 discovered that analyst reports on companies can affect their market's reaction with five trade days delay. In the market, the trading date is the day that an investor's order is executed. Our result shows that some time is still needed for getting news to trading. It is reasonable to expect that public opinion on the market will only affect the stock fluctuation with some delay.\nIn our experiment, 56 words are shown to provide sufficient evidence to determine that there is an association between the nature of the frequency items and the market fluctuations. However, among these 56 words, the coefficients of 25 words shrink to zero when using all of the three models (MCP_L, SLS_L and L_L models), meaning that they are not effective. The remaining 31 words are effective, that is, the coefficients of them are not zero in at least one of the three models. In our manuscript, Table 2 shows the 31 words. It is expected that the evaluation of prediction performance can also provide an indirect evaluation of the textual implications of the models and representative features. To gain further insights, we now more closely investigate overlapping keywords detected by MCP_L, SLS_L and L_L models. These 25 keywords of overlaps are identified by all the models. Some keywords are expressed as the expectations or needs of investors and their trading activities, like pessimistic ( 悲观 ), Cool down ( 冷却 ), Rise ( 升至 ). Some keywords represent the current event and financial topics, like Demographic Dividend ( 人口红利 ), Real Economy ( 实体经济 ), Securitization( 证券化 ). Some keywords indicate sufficient statistical meaning, that is, a stable relationship between keywords, like Intensify ( 加 剧 ), Prefer ( 首先 ). Some keywords reflect correspondence to target indicator, like company name, city name. Searching published literature suggest that these keywords may have important implications. Recent evidences in behavior finance indicates that emotion influence stock market returns 6,39 . Previous studies suggest that the demographic variable can be related to the information component determining long-horizon stock market returns 40 . Westerhoff shows the interactions between the real economy and stock market 41 . Fontana and Godin find the links between housing market and financial sector by taking into account the securitization process 42 . Our result indicates events that most certainly influences stock market prices, public sentiment and opinion may play an equally important role in predicting stock movement.\nThe striking finding in Table 2 is that only five out of 25 terms have a positive impact on financial markets. Apparently even the positive word \"Securitization( 证券化 )\" received a negative connotation. The strongest positive indicator is \"Imagine( 想象 )\", and the strongest negative indicator is \"Concern( 关注度 )\". This finding seems to echo what Soroka 43 and Wu et al. 44 discovered earlier-responses to positive and negative information are asymmetric-that negative information has a much greater impact on individuals' attitudes than does positive information.",

The strongest positive indicator is \"Imagine( 想象 )\", and the strongest negative indicator is \"Concern( 关注度 )\". This finding seems to echo what Soroka 43 and Wu et al. 44 discovered earlier-responses to positive and negative information are asymmetric-that negative information has a much greater impact on individuals' attitudes than does positive information.",
