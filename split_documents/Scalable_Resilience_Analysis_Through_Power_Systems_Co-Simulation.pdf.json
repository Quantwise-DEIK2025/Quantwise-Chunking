        "text": "PowDDeR calculates a system’s resilience metric by capturing real-time inertia and available adaptive capacity in real and reactive power, providing a measure of the system’s ability to respond to disturbances.\n\nPowDDeR is a software application developed to provide a specific resilience metric for a power system. It is based on the systems adaptive capacity and inertia. Given a set of generation assets in the system, PowDDeR captures the systems real-time inertia and the available adaptive capacity in real and reactive power looking forward in time. It gives a measure of a power system's ability to respond to disturbances, either natural, such as weather related, or human, such as cyberphysical attacks.\nThe adaptive capacity of a generation asset is bound by its operational generation limits based on its current operation point and the speed it can ramp up and down its output power. The operational limit is the maximum real and reactive power output capability at any power factor angle θ . The real and reactive power components at any power factor are given by\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nand\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nrespectively. Here S is the apparent power limit calculated with the nameplate real and reactive capacity, given as\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nThe operational limit of the asset must be translated based on its real-time generation in real power, P 0, and reactive power, Q 0, resulting in components given by\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nfor the real power and\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nfor the reactive component. The temporal limits of real/reactive power outputs are defined by the latency λ and ramp rates, as mathematically expressed in equations (6), (7),\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere t is the future time, dP / dt is the real power ramping rate, and dQ / dt is the reactive power ramping rate.\nFIGURE 2. MIRACL-CSP architecture.\nThe adaptive capacity is therefore bound by the real and reactive power component limits given in equations (4) and (5) and the temporal limits defined in equations (6) and (7). This results in a ''manifold'' that represents the adaptive capacity of an asset. The manifold and a more detailed derivation, which covers the aggregation of assets can be found in [9]. Further derivations including uncertainty in solar PV and battery assets have been shown in [10], as well as hydropower generation assets in [11].\nThe inertia of power systems comes from generation units that have rotating masses or stored kinetic energy. The kinetic energy slows the rate of frequency response to disturbances on the system, given as\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere 1 P is the disturbance or difference between generation and load, and H is the inertial constant. A large amount of inertia on the system allows for additional time for generation units to ramp up or down output to arrest the frequency before it reaches the point of under frequency load shed (UFLS) or over frequency generator tripping. The kinetic energy of a generator is given as\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere f 0 , Np , and J are the real-time frequency, number of poles, and the mass moment of inertia, respectively. The kinetic energy can also be evaluated at the maximum and minimum frequency limits of the system to give the available kinetic energy. In the case of UFLS, this is given as\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nThe available kinetic energy is used to find the amount of time it takes for a disturbance to result in a limiting frequency being reached, given as\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere Pd is the size of the power disturbance.\nThe short-term resilience in this paper is based on the ability of the system to arrest frequency prior to an UFLS event. This occurs when a disturbance results in load being greater than the generation. In this scenario, the frequency begins to drop and generation assets begin to increase their output power to re-balance the load. Therefore, the short-term resilience is the maximum size of disturbance the system can withstand and is calculated using the aggregated adaptive capacity in the positive real-power direction and the inertia or time it takes to reach the UFLS after the disturbance. The short-term resilience in regards to the DIRE curve (Fig. 1) relates to the 'resist' phase and its derivation can be seen in more detail in [22].\nThe long-term resilience is defined by the positive real power adaptive capacity over a large time span. It relates to the energy left in the system and gives a measure of the time the system can maintain generation. With regard to the DIRE curve, the long-term resilience is in the time frames of the 'respond' and 'recover' phases. In the St. Mary's microgrid it relates to the amount of time a generator can run based on its remaining fuel, its fuel burn rate, and the generators power output. The simulations ran in this study were over a short time duration of 350 seconds. In order to demonstrate the long-term resilience, the time axis is changed from seconds to hours. The longer time horizon allows a measurable reduction in the amount of fuel remaining, resulting in a change to the long-term resilience.\nIn this study framework, PowDDeR becomes part of the UCC. Through the HELICS Python APIs, the UCC monitors and processes required GridLAB-D asset information.

        "original_text": "PowDDeR is a software application developed to provide a specific resilience metric for a power system. It is based on the systems adaptive capacity and inertia. Given a set of generation assets in the system, PowDDeR captures the systems real-time inertia and the available adaptive capacity in real and reactive power looking forward in time. It gives a measure of a power system's ability to respond to disturbances, either natural, such as weather related, or human, such as cyberphysical attacks.\nThe adaptive capacity of a generation asset is bound by its operational generation limits based on its current operation point and the speed it can ramp up and down its output power. The operational limit is the maximum real and reactive power output capability at any power factor angle θ . The real and reactive power components at any power factor are given by\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nand\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nrespectively. Here S is the apparent power limit calculated with the nameplate real and reactive capacity, given as\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nThe operational limit of the asset must be translated based on its real-time generation in real power, P 0, and reactive power, Q 0, resulting in components given by\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nfor the real power and\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nfor the reactive component. The temporal limits of real/reactive power outputs are defined by the latency λ and ramp rates, as mathematically expressed in equations (6), (7),\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere t is the future time, dP / dt is the real power ramping rate, and dQ / dt is the reactive power ramping rate.\nFIGURE 2. MIRACL-CSP architecture.\nThe adaptive capacity is therefore bound by the real and reactive power component limits given in equations (4) and (5) and the temporal limits defined in equations (6) and (7). This results in a ''manifold'' that represents the adaptive capacity of an asset. The manifold and a more detailed derivation, which covers the aggregation of assets can be found in [9]. Further derivations including uncertainty in solar PV and battery assets have been shown in [10], as well as hydropower generation assets in [11].\nThe inertia of power systems comes from generation units that have rotating masses or stored kinetic energy. The kinetic energy slows the rate of frequency response to disturbances on the system, given as\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere 1 P is the disturbance or difference between generation and load, and H is the inertial constant. A large amount of inertia on the system allows for additional time for generation units to ramp up or down output to arrest the frequency before it reaches the point of under frequency load shed (UFLS) or over frequency generator tripping. The kinetic energy of a generator is given as\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere f 0 , Np , and J are the real-time frequency, number of poles, and the mass moment of inertia, respectively. The kinetic energy can also be evaluated at the maximum and minimum frequency limits of the system to give the available kinetic energy. In the case of UFLS, this is given as\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nThe available kinetic energy is used to find the amount of time it takes for a disturbance to result in a limiting frequency being reached, given as\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere Pd is the size of the power disturbance.\nThe short-term resilience in this paper is based on the ability of the system to arrest frequency prior to an UFLS event. This occurs when a disturbance results in load being greater than the generation. In this scenario, the frequency begins to drop and generation assets begin to increase their output power to re-balance the load. Therefore, the short-term resilience is the maximum size of disturbance the system can withstand and is calculated using the aggregated adaptive capacity in the positive real-power direction and the inertia or time it takes to reach the UFLS after the disturbance. The short-term resilience in regards to the DIRE curve (Fig. 1) relates to the 'resist' phase and its derivation can be seen in more detail in [22].\nThe long-term resilience is defined by the positive real power adaptive capacity over a large time span. It relates to the energy left in the system and gives a measure of the time the system can maintain generation.

The St. Mary's power distribution feeder system is a 12.47 kV and 400 V system. The total load of the system can reach a peak of approximately 600 kW, with a minimum load hitting approximately 150 kW. Because it is situated in such a remote location with the associated challenges to supply energy to consumers, the price of energy is rather high, more than double the average U.S. household in 2022 according to [23] and [24]. The power demand of the St. Mary's community is served by three diesel generators listed in Table 1.

When they are taken off-line, they no longer add any inertia to the system.\nIn this case, the resulting short-term resilience is shown in Fig. 6e. Here, it can be seen that the short-term resilience not only follows the frequency of the system, but, more importantly, it takes a large step reduction when a generator is taken off-line. This results in the system not being able to withstand large disturbances before frequency limits are reached. The long-term resilience is shown in Fig. 6f. Here, the long-term resilience contribution of each generator is shown along with system's resilience.

The key takeaway that can be seen is the trade-off between short-term and longterm resilience. Examining scenario 2, you can see that when a generator goes off-line it has a large negative impact to the short-term resilience because of the reduced inertia and generation ramping capability. However, it has a positive effect on the long-term resilience. This is due to the system no longer burning as much fuel to support the load. It should be noted that this is only possible because the generators are not being run near their maximum generation capability, therefore they can be ramped up to support the load demand.\nAnother key takeaway is that the short-term and long-term resilience metrics do not directly show the impact of wind generation. In the case of the short-term resilience, wind does not directly add inertia to the system and it is ran at its maximum output. In order to add to the short-term resilience, the wind turbine generator can be ran below its maximum capability. The impact to resilience based on the dynamics of different generation assets has been demonstrated in [22]. Here, it was shown that the quick ramping capability of inverter-based generation can have a large impact to maintain frequency stability. For the long-term resilience, wind\ngeneration allows for diesel generators to be taken off-line, conserving the fuel, and therefore increasing the long-term resilience.",

The intended purpose of this platform was to integrate the dynamics of the distribution system with the resilience assessment and quantification metric. As a use case for the proposed platform to quantitatively study the resilience of a microgrid in a holistic manner, we analyzed the resilience of the real world St. Mary's microgrid incorporating a 900 kW wind turbine generator under different scenarios dictated by real-life uncertainties using PowDDeR, a software application providing resilience metrics for power systems based on their adaptive capacity and inertia. The integration of PowDDeR with GridLAB-D, the St. Mary's microgrid power flow simulator, is facilitated by MIRACL-CSP so that the resilience application could monitor and analyze distribution system measurements in real time. The co-simulation environment allowed us to collect system dynamics data to characterize its resilience at different time scales.\nThe resilience results of the St. Mary's microgrid show a trade-off between short-term and long-term resilience. Having diesel generators online add to the short-term resilience as there is more inertia in the system and a quicker ramping capability if a disturbance occurs. However, this results in faster reduction of fuel and therefore a quicker reduction in long-term resilience. The contribution of wind generation has the ability to increase either the short-term or long-term resilience depending on how it is utilized. If it is run at maximum output, diesel generation can be taken off-line. If it is run below its maximum output, the fast ramping capability of inverters allows for increased short-term resilience of the system. Future work includes leveraging MIRACL-CSP as the practical framework for asset owners and operators, and original equipment providers to understand benefit versus risk through co-optimization of resilience and economic considerations for applications. With DW as a resilience enhancement, the resilience metrics can be used as control decisions to benefit the overall system efficiency, and the cost of operation in particular.\nMoreover, MIRACL-CSP serves as a prototype for complex systems integration with dynamic resilience quantitative metrics, and could be adapted and/or extended for studies pertaining to other domains, such as chemical and water infrastructure systems.",
