The results showed that the number of road infrastructure in Inner Mongolia had a strong positive impact on economic growth, but a strong negative impact on urban-rural income inequality at the county level [4]. Qu et al. employed large-scale remote sensing data, a topographic fluctuation range model, and a spatial econometric model to analyze the multifunctional change and its dynamic mechanism of gully agriculture in the Loess Plateau to understand the internal meaning of evolution and differentiation at the basin level. The results indicated that many key policies in the Loess Plateau would directly affect the evolution path of functions, thus providing policy ideas for the high-quality development of agriculture in the Loess Plateau [5]. Luo et al., taking the Shenzhen-Shantou Special Cooperation Zone (SSSCZ) as an example, constructed a runoff model based on SSSCZ and a rainstorm and flood model based on Geographic Information System (GIS). They discussed the spatial distribution characteristics of rainstorms and flood risks lasting for 100 years. It was found that applyingthe neural network method to urban planning and construction can comprehensively consider waterlogging, ecology, population, and so on [6].Jia et al. proposed a more powerful multi-swarm artificial bee colony algorithm (ABCA). The classic ABCA was improved in the algorithm, and multi-group and exclusive operation strategies were adopted to make it suitable for the optimal parameter setting tracking of the SOFM network so that this network could be applied to a dynamic environment. The results denoted that the algorithm was superior to the classical SOFM algorithm in clustering purity and effectiveness. It was a promising classification method for dynamic environment data streams [7]. To improve autonomous vehicles' handling performance and stability, a coordinated control strategy based on stability judgment was proposed by Yao et al. [8]. Firstly, the stability judgment scheme based on the SOFM neural network and K-Means algorithm was adopted to evaluate the real-time stability level of vehicles. The results suggested that the\nstability judgment scheme and coordinated control strategy of the algorithm could meet the requirements of path-tracking accuracy and enhance its processing and stability [8].\nThese studies deeply analyze different aspects of rural revitalization and provide an essential theoretical basis for future development and policy formulation. Machine learning algorithms such as SOFM neural network and multi-swarm ABCA, as well as the application of IoT technology, provide a new way for intelligent and accurate decision-making in rural revitalization and construction. These technologies not only optimize the allocation of resources and improve the efficiency of decision-making but also better meet the diverse needs of rural residents and promote the development of rural revitalization in a more sustainable and dynamic direction.

This network can preserve the topological structure of data, meaning it retains the spatial relationships between data points, which is crucial for land consolidation and resource management. For instance, when planning land use in rural areas, SOFM can help identify key information such as land types, land quality, and land-use history and integrate them to formulate more effective land consolidation strategies. Additionally, SOFM can achieve data dimensionality reduction, compressing large datasets into more manageable forms, thus reducing computational and time costs. Furthermore, IoT technology provides rich sources of data for digital finance research. IoT devices can gather information about rural areas through real-time data collection and transmission, such as meteorological data, soil moisture, crop growth conditions, etc. These data can be used for intelligent decision-making, such as precise irrigation and fertilization, and support monitoring and early warning systems, helping farmers better manage agricultural production.\nThe SOFM neural network is an unsupervised learning algorithm capable of transforming high-dimensional data into a two-dimensional grid structure through self-organizing mapping of input data, thus realizing data clustering and visual analysis [10], [11], [12]. The SOFM neural network operates on the foundational principle of competitive learning, structured around input and competitive layers. The competitive layer is usually a two-dimensional grid, and each node represents the weight of a feature vector [13]. During network training, the input data is compared with the weight vector in the competition layer, and the best-matching neuron is selected as the winning neuron. Subsequently, the topolog-\nical mapping of the input data is realized by updating the weights of the winning neuron and its surrounding neurons [14], [15], [16].The research method roadmap is illustrated in Figure 1.\nFirstly, the SOFM neural network model starts competitive learning by accepting input samples. In this process, samples with similar functional attributes exhibit a similar trend in spatial distribution, while samples with large differences in functional attributes keep a certain interval in space. This principle makes it possible to cluster irregular input samples automatically [17]. When the number of input samples is sufficient, its probability density can be approximately regarded as the weight distribution, which can be expressed in the neurons of the output layer of the neural network. This results in that all samples with large probability density will be gathered in a specific area in the output space [18], [19], [20], [21].\nRural revitalization projects can benefit by combining the SOFM neural network with IoT technology. The richness of data allows decision-makers to gain better insights into the conditions of rural areas, enabling them to formulate policies and plans that are more targeted. The automation and analytical capabilities streamline the decision-making process, reducing the workload associated with manual data processing. Most importantly, real-time capabilities enable decisions to respond more rapidly to changing situations, such as sudden weather variations or disaster events, thereby reducing potential risks.\nFIGURE 1.

        "text": "Highlights the application of digital finance and SOFM neural networks for land consolidation zoning in A County, Shaanxi Province, identifying distinct ecological risk profiles across different areas and emphasizing the necessity of land consolidation to improve land quality and resource utilization.\n\nThis study discusses the application of digital finance based on the SOFM neural network and IoT technology in rural revitalization. Taking A County in Shaanxi Province as a case, a comprehensive index system is constructed, and the related factors of land consolidation projects are quantitatively analyzed. Through the results of the SOFM neural network, A county in Shaanxi Province is successfully divided into land consolidation project areas with similar attributes and adjacent space, and the zoning pattern of rural revitalization land is formulated.\nThekeyfindings of this study are as follows. (1) Significant differences exist in soil ecological risk, water environment ecological risk, biodiversity ecological risk, and landscape pattern ecological risk among different regions. Area C exhibits lower risk levels across all ecological risk aspects, while Area B shows higher risk values. (2) The study results underscore the importance of land consolidation. Areas A and D have relatively higher landscape pattern ecological risk, indicating the necessity of land consolidation projects to optimize land use patterns and enhance land ecological quality. These key findings have significant implications for rural revitalization and development. Firstly, the differences in ecological risk highlight the need for targeted policies and plans to accommodate the ecological environment needs of different areas. Rural revitalization strategies must consider the ecological variations among areas to ensure sustainable development. Secondly, land consolidation is crucial in improving the land ecological quality and landscape patterns. For areas with higher landscape pattern ecological risk, the planning and implementing land consolidation projects will contribute to more efficient land resource utilization, providing a better land foundation for rural revitalization. In summary, these key findings emphasize the importance of ecological environment and land use in rural revitalization and provide policymakers with insights on effectively promoting sustainable rural development.\nThis study has made several specific contributions to rural revitalization, advancing existing knowledge. In comparison to other research, the primary contributions are as follows. Firstly, there is an improvement in the ecological risk assessment method. This study has developed a comprehensive ecological risk assessment method by considering\nmultiple ecological factors such as soil, water environment, biodiversity, and landscape patterns. This method is conducive to gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the ecological health status in various areas, providing more specific guidance for rural revitalization planning. Secondly, the importance of land consolidation projects is emphasized. The study results highlight the crucial role of land consolidation in improving land ecological quality and landscape patterns. This offers strong evidence for decision-makers and planners, demonstrating the essential nature of land consolidation projects for the sustainability of rural revitalization.",
