Cloud has become popular due to its unique characteristics. Some of the cloud characteristics also negatively impact the quality of service. The unique GLYPH<28>ve characteristics of cloud which improve performance can also increase risks [1]. For instance, there are several applications for which missing any provisioning of services is considered as a failure [2]. Broad network access introduces new challenges. The networking service reliability, availability, and latency directly impact the Quality of Service (QoS) in a cloud environment. Another characteristic is related to rapid elasticity. If the service is not capable of adapting to the current load then elasticity failure may occur that will impact the reliability of the service. The last feature concerns the measured service. The measured service is the computation of resource usage. If any loss or unavailability of resources occurs, it can lead to unreliable or inaccurate estimation in data-related measurements.\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was Ali Kashif Bashir .\nThe fundamental characteristic of the cloud is resource sharing by multiple users. Resources in the cloud can be dynamically re-allocated based on users' demands and preferences. Allocating resources appropriately is considered one of the primary concerns in cloud computing. The word appropriate can be any of the performance metrics: cost-effectiveness, accuracy, and reliability. Allocating resource appropriately refers to such an allocation that integrates the resource utilization of the service providers while meeting customer's requirements. Allocation of an\noptimal resource must avoid resource contention, fragmentation, over-provisioning, and under-provisioning. Resource contention occurs when several applications request the same resources at a speciGLYPH<28>c time. Due to the unavailability of resources, scarcity of resources may happen. Fragmentation of resources may take place for resource isolation. Over-provisioning happens if providers allocate more resources than the demand and under-provisioning may happen if providers allocate fewer resources than its demand. We try to avoid all these cases in our resource allocation framework.\nThe main obstacles of this paradigm are reliability and security. To address reliability and security both, we propose a model using four quality attributes: availability, reliability, data integrity, and efGLYPH<28>ciency to estimate the trust value of a CSP.

In this work, we evaluate trust as a quantitative attribute and estimate the values of trust of different service providers based on our proposed four quality attributes. The values of the quality attributes are estimated based on a set of metrics through a simulation environment. We combine the four quality attributes as a weighted sum to obtain the trust of a provider.\n- GLYPH<15> We integrate the estimated trust value into a resource allocation model in a multi-cloud environment. The resource allocation model also considers the trafGLYPH<28>c and capacity of the CSPs to evaluate the communication delay. We design the model as a joint optimization problem and aim to maximize trust and minimize communication delay to improve the QoS.\n- GLYPH<15> We solve the resource allocation problem optimally and heuristically. Intlinprog in MATLAB is used as an optimizer to solve the proposed resource allocation model. The optimizer requires several hours to obtain an optimized solution in some scenarios. To avoid such situations, we use a meta-heuristic, a Genetic Algorithm for generating computationally efGLYPH<28>cient approximated solutions. We compare the results of our heuristics with the optimal solution. The solution of the Genetic algorithm achieves 90% similarity to the exact solution. The execution time of the Genetic Algorithm increases linearly with an increase in the number of the CSPs and servers.

The occurrence of failures is unpredictable and directly impacts the reliability of the cloud. Optimal allocation of resources in a cloud is crucial and can be solved using heuristics. The general process for allocating resources requires three parties: customer, broker, and service provider. At GLYPH<28>rst, customers specify the amounts of resources along with the constraints related to service performance. Then, a broker is responsible for GLYPH<28>nding a proper CSP or multiple CSPs that can satisfy customers' requirements and transfers the requests to the chosen CSPs. After that, CSPs allocate resources to their data centers based on availability. In such allocation, resource utilization, and customers' requirements both constraints are fulGLYPH<28>lled. Managing and optimizing the allocation of resources appropriately in a cloud environment is crucial. There have been many recent efforts to optimize resource allocation and we acknowledge a few of them below.\nAnalysis of hardware reliability of cloud and the causes of the failures impacting the reliability are discussed in [3]. The authors investigate different parameters such as server age, conGLYPH<28>guration, location, load executing on the infrastructure and conclude that none of the parameters directly impact the failures signiGLYPH<28>cantly. Selecting an optimal channel for improving reliability and minimizing energy budget is the objective of this work [4]. A machine learning approach with reliability improvement and energy awareness is applied in the proposed method. The unique dimensions of resource management in IoT such as managing memory, energy, and process are discussed with pros and cons [5]. A modiGLYPH<28>ed Max-Min algorithm is applied for allocating resources in a cloud environment [6]. The modiGLYPH<28>cation improves the average waiting time and completion time. The method maximizes the overall resource utilization. A model to evaluate cloud reliability is presented in [7]. The authors use a state transition graph with three states for the evaluation. A Semi-Markov model is used for estimating the reliability using the state transition probability. Some of the software failures are considered in the evaluation. For the physical\nresource breakdown, the authors use the mean-time to recovery and failure for availability and downtime. Failures of all main elements of a cloud are not considered in the estimation of cloud reliability. In the model, the authors calculate the reliability of each physical resource there is no focus on performing a reliable allocation of resources for the requested services. A reliability evaluation model for cloud environment is presented in [8]. The model proposes some attributes and metrics for reliability evaluation. Four quality attributes are chosen for calculating the reliability of a cloud. For each of the attributes, the authors proposed some metrics for the estimation and GLYPH<28>nally combine them using a weighted sum technique. Based on response time, reliability and performance in a cloud are presented in [9]. The response time was calculated based on three parameters: waiting time, service time, and execution time. Queuing theory is applied in the estimation of waiting time and service time. Response time was estimated by combining the above attributes. Faragardi et al. [10] proposed an evaluation model for cloud reliability. To evaluate system reliability, they considered the reliability of servers and links.\nThe primary concern of most of the research is optimizing resource utilization. Resource allocation techniques are discussed with an objective to control various parameters: costs, execution time, and scheduling policy. For instance, Obtaining the minimum servers is the objective of this scheme [11]. The authors propose a heuristic for an allocation that minimizes the requirements of the servers through response time distribution. The effectiveness of the mechanism is evaluated with several performance measurements. The approach does not consider any other parameters that also directly impact service performance. Scheduling task in an efGLYPH<28>cient manner while minimizing the power consumption is the aim of this work [12]. A prediction mechanism is used for allocating resources and reducing power consumption. A resource allocation problem in a cloud radio access network is shown in the model for choosing the optimal technique to combine all the available spectral bands [13]. A modiGLYPH<28>ed version of the cloud radio access network is proposed for handling spectral resources efGLYPH<28>ciently. Another model for minimizing the server quantity of cloud is presented in [14]. A prediction algorithm that can model the load in advance is applied to predict future resource usages. The authors presented an evaluation to prove the validity of the proposed model. The evaluation shows that it can avoid the occurring of overload and achieve green computing. A resource allocation scheme for monitoring and predicting future requirements is proposed in [15]. The scheme adjusts VMs based on actual resource needs. There are two primary challenges to this task. The GLYPH<28>rst one is when to reallocate resources and the second one is how much resource needs adjustment. However, the performance shows the applicability of the method but adjusting and selecting the threshold is critical and it significantly impacts resource optimization. For a hybrid Cloud, Grewal and Pateria [16] propose a resource provisioning technique. A private cloud is capable of scaling up using\npublic cloud resources with the help of a resource manager. In allocating resources, most of the approaches are concerned only with resource utilization. To improve the performance, integration of several other performance metrics like reliability, efGLYPH<28>ciency should also be required into the allocation model.\nFor an appropriate VM allocation in a cloud, a trafGLYPH<28>c-aware algorithm is presented in [17]. A swarm optimization algorithm is applied for solving the VM allocation problem. The simulation results show that the algorithm can signiGLYPH<28>cantly improve energy consumption and control the loss of communication links. The authors propose a model to maximize resource utilization and minimize energy consumption [18]. A particle swarm optimization method is used to solve the problem. A cloud resource allocation model to improve security is proposed by Halabi et al. [19]. The authors designed the allocation problem as an optimization problem and propose a heuristic for the solution. For forecasting the utilization of resources in a data center, a Genetic Algorithm is proposed in [20]. The GA forecasts the requirements of the resources depending on the previous data. A resource allocation approach depending on resource prediction is also proposed in the work. The validity and applicability of the method are presented through simulation results. The results show that GA is superior for an accurate prediction. Moreover, it improves the utilization of CPU and memory and the consumption of energy. Finally, a fault-aware resource allocation for cloud is proposed by Gupta and Ghrera [21]. The authors aim for the maximization of the utilization of resources and consumption of power for the servers.\nMost of the research in this area proposes approaches to evaluate some quality attributes and optimize those attributes. The absence of standard quantitative attributes and metrics and the incompleteness in considering the major elements of cloud infrastructure are ensured through the existing cloud literature. No research work in the literature considers most of the major cloud elements in the evaluation to improve QoS. The objective of our approach is to maximize trust and minimize the communication delay to improve service performance. Trust will be calculated based on the availability, reliability, data integrity, and efGLYPH<28>ciency of a CSP while allocating resources efGLYPH<28>ciently based on users' requirements. Consideration of trust and communication delay together in the optimization problem makes our model demanding and appropriate.",

The approach uses formulas to calculate trust based on request acceptance rates and successful request rates, utilizing a weighted sum of these metrics. It employs a layered architecture with a simulator to model cloud components and resource allocation.\n\nTrust is evaluated quantitatively in the proposed model. We use two steps to evaluate the trust of a CSP. One is workload modeling that involves the assessment of the arrival rates of requests for resources such as CPU, memory, bandwidth requirements placed by users. In the second step, system modeling aims at evaluating the performance of a cloud system at the allocation based on the performance of the service providers.

Proposed trust evaluation approach.\nWe compute trust based on the previous credentials of the CSPs using the four quality attributes and our proposed evaluation metrics shown in Fig. 1. Availability is one of the major concerning parameters in a cloud environment. Availability is calculated based on the resource availability of a CSP. All cloud service providers emphasize the availability of their service in their Service Level Agreement (SLA). Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM, and Salesforce maintain the availability of 99.9% which is still lower than the expectation [23]GLYPH<21>[26]. The availability of a CSP is calculated based on the rate of the accepted and total requests.

Reliability of cloud is not addressed or appropriately considered by the previous cloud researchers [27], [28]. However, due to many outages in a cloud, reliability issues have become a major concern in a cloud environment. We consider reliability as a failure-free operation. In terms of failures in the cloud, we consider hardware and software failures. Reliability is calculated based on the rate of successful and accepted requests.

The reliability of CSP n is calculated as below where SUrq is the rate of successful requests and ACrq is the rate of accepted requests.\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nData integrity considers data loss due to latency and network failures.

We use a two-point crossover process to have the better parts of parent chromosomes. In the process, the selected chromosomes exchange their parts and create two new child chromosomes. A single bit of the chromosome is changed in mutation operation, and thereby a new chromosome is generated. We assign the crossover and mutation rates and based on the values the operations occur in the algorithm.

        "text": "Describes the experimental setup and data collection methods used to evaluate the resource allocation model.\n\nThe details of the experiments and results analysis are discussed in this section. CloudSim [31] is used for cloud data collection, and MATLAB is used for the optimized resource allocation in the experiments. We perform the experiments in multiple scenarios for testing the applicability of the approach. We implement the trust evaluation model using CloudSim and obtain the required data to calculate the trust of a CSP. Finally, the performance of the optimization model for resource allocation is compared with the exact optimized solution and the performance of the proposed heuristic is presented.\nWe obtain the necessary cloud data to compute trust from the experiments executed in the CloudSim environment. Based on the collected data, we calculate the trust of different CSPs. We use the trust value of our model and integrate this in the optimization model to execute the optimizer and GA in MATLAB environments to analyze the performance. To run experiments, we use an Intel Core i7 machine with a 4 GHz processor. In GA, we set the population size based on our requirements and generation size to 1000.\nWe execute the proposed model in four distinct scenarios. The number of servers and CSPs are varied in each of the scenarios. We modify the number of servers and CSPs from 30 to 60 and 6 to 12 respectively. In each scenario, the number of servers is increased by 10 and CSPs by 2. The above scenarios may represent real scenarios as the number of CSPs that can participate together cannot be more as several constraints need to be fulGLYPH<28>lled.\nThe trust of a CSP is estimated using the weighted sum of the value of availability, reliability, data integrity, and time efGLYPH<28>ciency. Fig. 3 depicts the trend of the availability metric with respect to different loads. The number of incoming requests and executing loads are varied, and three distinct cases are considered. A small load represents the number of requests and executing loads are minimum, on the other hand, there is one case with a maximum or heavy load. In between the minimum and maximum loads, we also consider one case which we name medium load. The trend in the GLYPH<28>gure shows that with a small load the availability is maximum and with a heavy load it is minimum. For calculating the availability value, we consider several such scenarios and take the average of 10 executions of those scenarios for the availability value.\nFIGURE 3. Resources availability with different loads.\nFor calculating reliability, we consider some of the hardware and software failures and combine them together to get the reliability attribute. In case of hardware failures, failures of virtual machines and processing elements are considered. The required software that is involved to process requests and execute workload is considered software failures. We execute several experiments with variations in the requests and loads\nFIGURE 4. Reliability of resources with different loads.\nFIGURE 5. Data integrity with different loads.\nand show that in Fig. 4. The reliability trend depicts that failures are more frequent in the case of a maximum number of requests and loads.\nFig. 5 shows the trend of the value of data integrity that was varied with the variations of the different loads. Fig. 6 conGLYPH<28>rms the efGLYPH<28>ciency in terms of the required time for all the different scenarios. In an ideal case, it is supposed to be 1 but practically we can try to get closer to the maximum possible value. After obtaining all the four attributes, we take the averages of all the attributes and combined them together as a weighted sum to get the trust value of one CSP.\nFig. 7 shows an important performance trend of the approach on the basis of trust value. The trust value is calculated using the weighted sum of availability, reliability, data integrity, and time efGLYPH<28>ciency. The results show the variation in the values of trust of our model with a variation in the weight. A 0.25 value in the weight of trust means trust is considered partially but the delay has more weight which is 0.75 in the objective function. Similarly, the other side is also considered in the objective function. A weight value of 0.5 indicates an equal weight on both of the objective functions. Fig. 7 shows that the trust of the model improves approximately 10% in all distinct scenarios. This performance gain ensures the validity of the approach.\nFIGURE 6. Time efficiency with different loads.\nFIGURE 7. Trust with different weight values.\nFIGURE 8. Delay with different weight values.\nFig. 8 depicts the trends of delay. The same weight variations are considered to show the variations in the values of communication delay. Applying the model delay is decreased by approximately 10%. The performance improvement is not massive but even a small reduction of delay improves the quality of service. The results can be more prominent in the real environment.\nFIGURE 9. Objective value comparison between optimal and genetic algorithm.\nFIGURE 10. Execution time comparison between optimal and genetic algorithm.\nFig. 9 shows one of the principal performance trends of the approach that is the objective value. The objectives of trust and delay are combined to calculate the objective value. The obtained value of the objective in the approach is nearly the same as an optimal solution. The aim is to maximize trust and minimize delay, and the proposed GA achieves almost the same objective values as an optimizer. The performance trend remains the same while varying the size of the problem in terms of CSPs and servers. This trend conGLYPH<28>rms that the proposed model is appropriate in a large cloud environment.\nFig. 10 also shows the performance of the approach on the basis of execution time. Results depict a linear increase in the execution time with an increase in the number of CSPs and servers. The above trend conGLYPH<28>rms the usability of the approach in real scenarios. The results exhibit that increase in the problem size does not require any noticeable execution time. This trend provides the assurance of the approach while increasing trust and decreasing delay. Moreover, the execution time of the approach is more signiGLYPH<28>cant compare to the optimizer in a large scenario.\nFig. 11 reveals the Pareto front obtained from the proposed heuristic. The trade-off between the objective functions is depicted using the Pareto front. Allocating resources in the\nFIGURE 11.

Distributing resources will reduce delay as the load will be divided but trust will be decreased.\nThe performance results show that the trust of different CSPs is effectively estimated while varying the simulation environments.
