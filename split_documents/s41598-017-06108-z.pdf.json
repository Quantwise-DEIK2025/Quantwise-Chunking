The best fit for α is approximately 1, but the fit is only accurate for a portion of the data.\n\nSimple gravity model. Before we can verify if the gravity model can reproduce the weights of flight connections, we need to determine the value of the constant G in Eq. (1). To do this, one has to keep in mind that, in Eq. (1), in addition to G , there is another free parameter, namely the distance coefficient α . This coefficient is usually found from the slope of the linear relation (see, e.g., Fig. 1 in ref. 17)\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nWe will discuss the distance coefficient in the next subsection. At the moment, let us assume, that it its value is known.\nIn the systems, such as the international trade network, where the flow between i and j only depends on the importance of trading countries, the constant G can be simply obtained from Eq. (1),\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nafter summing over all pairs of countries, i.e.\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere X is the total world GDP, and the left side of Eq. (5) is related to a distance-averaged value of a typical trade channel. This shows that for a fixed value of α , the parameter G can be calculated directly from real data. Unfortunately, this is not the case of the airline network.\nIn the air-transport network, besides the main contribution to the flow f ij coming from the'direct passengers' traveling from i to j , the value f ij also contains those travellers, for which the flight i -j is only an intermediate link in a longer chain of flights. In other words, the total number of occupied seats, i.e., the sum of all the elements f ij of the matrix F ( t ),\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nis larger than the total number of traveling people. In particular, people traveling from i to j with one change occur in this sum twice. Correspondingly, those who travel with two changes (i.e., with three connecting flights) are taken three times. Therefore, the global traffic T can be estimated as follows:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere the summation runs over all pairs of countries ( i , j ), such that the shortest path between them, in terms of the number of links, is dij , and the expected flow f ij g ( ) is given by the gravity equation (1),\nFigure 1.

This means that the constant G can be estimated from the following relation\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nHaving the constant G estimated, one can plot the observed flows, f ij , versus these expected, f ij q ( ) . In Fig. 1, we present the data for two different years, 1996 and 2004, and for three different values of the distance parameter, α = 0, 1, and 3. The straight line demonstrating the expected flows f ij g ( ) , resulting from Eq. (8), is also drawn for better comparison. Let us note that the noise, which is inherent to the raw data, makes it difficult to clearly estimate the plotted relation (see Fig. 1b). To overcome this problem, in all the figures, we present logarithmically binned data only.\nIt is obvious that the direct applicability of the gravity model to the flight network is at least questionable. The best fit is obtained for α ≈ 1 (panels b) and e) in Fig. 1), which coincides with the results obtained by other studies of the distance coefficient in econometric data 17 . However, even if one agrees with such a choice of the distance coefficient, the fit is correct only for the right part of each plot. Over a span of at least three decades, the expected, f ij g ( ) , and the observed flows, f ij , differ even by several decades. It seems that there are important factors at play other than economic ones that increase the passenger flow between some countries. In the next section, we will show that the connecting flights from country i to j , which do not depend of the economic conditions, xi xj , of these two countries, can radically change the total flow f ij , and we explain the discrepancies between the gravity model and real data presented above.\nModel of connecting flights. We claim that the passenger flow, f ij , from country i to country j , that is observed in the data, is composed of two components:\nFigure 2. Graphical presentation of the summations in Eq. (10).\n- f ij g ( ) - the number of passengers traveling directly from the origin of a trip in the country i to the final destination in country j , which, we assume, is given by Eq. (8),\n- and the number of passengers, f ij transit ( ) , who use the connection i → j as a part of their longer journey.\nFor simplicity, we assume that these longer journeys consist of two direct flights only, i.e., we neglect travels with two or more intermediate stops. This assumption seems to be quite strong. For example, for 2004, we have flight data for 151 countries and 22650 possible connections between them. Only 2308 (10%) of them are direct. There are also 12749 (56%) shortest paths with length equal to 2. It means that we take into consideration only 66% of all possible connections between the countries. However, it is reasonable to expect that the number of passengers traveling with two or more stops is much lesser than the lacking 34% of the global traffic. One of the possible reasons for this is that too many transfers complicate the chance for a convenient schedule, which costs valuable time. Then, it is usually better to choose other kind of transportation to reach a destination. We will come back to this issue later when we discuss the obtained results.\nThe number of passengers f ij transit ( ) can be estimated as follows:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere the first (second) summation is over such nodes k (respectively l ), that there is no direct connection from i to k (from l to j ). The term p ( i → j → k ) describes the probability that one takes a direct flight from i to j during indirect travel from i to k . Contributions of both summations to the total transit passenger flow f ij transit ( ) are graphically depicted in Fig. 2.\nThe choice of a particular connecting flight from i through j to k (which is expressed by the probability p ( i → j → k )) should depend, in the first approximation, on the distance r ij between i and j , and the distance r jk between j and k . Thus, we omit the other factors such as the convenient flight schedules and type or level of airline service or airport quality, that could influence actual passenger behaviour 18 . Therefore,\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere C is a normalization constant, which is given by\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nand the function f ( r ij , r jk ) should reflect the tendency of the passengers to choose the shortest, and therefore, the cheapest or the fastest connections.

        "text": "Comparison of model performance with real data for 1996 and 2004, highlighting discrepancies for long-distance countries with low GDPs and demonstrating the model’s ability to predict over 98% of total passenger flow.\n\nIn Fig. 3, we compare results obtained from our model of connected flights with real data for two different years, 1996 and 2004. We also plot there the straight lines corresponding to the classical GM, Eq. (8), to demonstrate a significant improvement in performance of the expanded model over GM alone. The largest discrepancies visible in the left part of the plots occur for the long-distance countries with low GDPs, i.e., for large (small) values of the denominator (nominator) in the horizontal axis in Fig. 3. We have checked that these countries are usually island-based (African, Caribbean and Pacific states), and therefore, the travel between them requires multiple transfers - the feature that is not included in our one-stop model. Moreover, a lack of transport alternatives in these countries makes air travel channels more preferred than in the typical continental states. Although it is possible to extend the model to include two-stop connections, we think it is not worth the price, i.e., the significantly increased complexity of the model, especially since its present form correctly predicts more than 98% of the total passenger flow in the world.\nThe numerical results for f ij mcf shown in Fig. 3 have been obtained for the particular values of the distance coefficient α (the reason why we have chosen α = 1.5 and α = 1.6 for years 1996 and 2004, respectively, will become clear shortly). One has to keep in mind that the other values of this quantity can lead to the different results and to better or worse agreement between the model and real data. We can use this observation to select the most probable value of α and to analyse the behaviour of the distance coefficient in time. As mentioned in the introduction, this behaviour can be strictly related with the progress of the globalization process in the context of transportation networks. Thus, analysing changes of the distance coefficient would provide another indicator of the rate of the global integration.\nFor every year in the analysed period 1990-2011, we have created the histograms of empirical and modelled flows, P ( f ij ) and P ( f ij mcf )( α ), respectively, in m = 15 logarithmically spaced bins. The examples of such normalized histograms for year 1996 are presented in Fig. 4b. As one can see, the histograms P ( f ij mcf )( α ) created for different values of the α parameter differ in agreement with the histogram of empirical flows (marked by the shaded grey area). To measure this agreement, ∆ ( α ), we use a simple RMS formula\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nIn Fig. 4a, we show how this quality measure, ∆ ( α ), depends on the parameter α in the year 1996. The clearly visible minimum at α = 1.5 indicates the correct value of the distance coefficient in this year.\nFigure 5 demonstrates the behaviour of the distance coefficient for the years 1990-2011 retrieved by this method. The general conclusion that follows from the figure is that the distance effect in air transportation network is constant over time and the globalization process, which is reflected in the distance coefficient has been stabilized in the XXI century. This conclusion confirms the other results (presented by the grey circles in Fig. 5) obtained in ref. 17, where the authors estimated the distance coefficient for the international trade network.\nNow, let us shortly analyse the major fluctuations around this constant distance coefficient. In Fig. 5, we have marked three historical events that could influence the behaviour of the distance coefficient in the same way as they had an impact on the whole aviation industry. Attacks in New York and Washington D.C. in September of 2001 started a chain of events such as SARS epidemic, additional terrorist attempts, wars, and rising oil prices, that cost the airline industry three years of growth. Airline revenues and traffic surpassed 2000 levels only in 2004 19 . The 2008 global financial crisis costed another several years of growth. The effect was further enhanced by the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland in 2010 that caused the closure of airspace over many countries. The correlation between the distance coefficient and all these events, shown in Fig. 5, confirms that they have a negative impact not only on airline revenues or air traffic but on the whole globalization process.\nFigure 4.

The year-by-year values of the distance coefficient α for the air transportation network resulting from the minimalization of the measure ∆ ( α ) (black squares) and for the world trade network taken from a previous paper 17 (grey circles).\nIt should be noted that the globalization process is sometimes conceptualized as a continuous reduction in the effective distance in the world 20 , which means that the distance coefficient should vanish in time. However, the observed temporary decrease in the distance coefficient is evidently negatively correlated with the progress of globalization. It confirms the recent observations that the distance coefficient is rather associated with the fractal dimension of the considered system and a decrease in this coefficient is the effect of decreasing number and weight of air transport connections, which reduce dimensionality of the system 17 .\nConcluding remarks. The presented model of connecting flights allowed us to retrieve, from the observed flow between any two countries, the terms corresponding to direct and transfer passengers utilizing this connection. Although we neglected many aspects that influence the choice of intermediate airports by travellers, the model allows to correctly predict more than 98% of the total passenger flow in the world. The only assumption we had to take into account was that the gravity model is applicable to the case of air transport network. The\ncorrectness of the above assumption was confirmed by the time behaviour of the retrieved distance coefficient that reflects several historical events with known strong economic impact.\nThere are still many possible research directions that may be worth exploring in this area. First, the most promising of these seems to be derivation of the so-called fluctuation-response relations 21 that would allow predictions of the changes in the flows f ij on the basis of changes in GDPs of the connected countries. Now, when we can determine direct and indirect contributions to the particular flow, this should be possible by the analogy to the similar approach done for international trade network 12 . Next, it would be challenging but also rewarding to extend the model taking into account, e.g., time schedules that strongly determine the passenger preference to select a particular intermediate airport. This would generally allow modelling of the microscopic time-dependent flows in the network. Analysing more detailed level of the air transportation network, in which the nodes represent rather single cities or even airports 22 than the whole countries, can also be interesting for strategic planning in the airport industry.",
        "original_text": "In Fig. 3, we compare results obtained from our model of connected flights with real data for two different years, 1996 and 2004. We also plot there the straight lines corresponding to the classical GM, Eq. (8), to demonstrate a significant improvement in performance of the expanded model over GM alone. The largest discrepancies visible in the left part of the plots occur for the long-distance countries with low GDPs, i.e., for large (small) values of the denominator (nominator) in the horizontal axis in Fig. 3. We have checked that these countries are usually island-based (African, Caribbean and Pacific states), and therefore, the travel between them requires multiple transfers - the feature that is not included in our one-stop model. Moreover, a lack of transport alternatives in these countries makes air travel channels more preferred than in the typical continental states. Although it is possible to extend the model to include two-stop connections, we think it is not worth the price, i.e., the significantly increased complexity of the model, especially since its present form correctly predicts more than 98% of the total passenger flow in the world.\nThe numerical results for f ij mcf shown in Fig. 3 have been obtained for the particular values of the distance coefficient α (the reason why we have chosen α = 1.5 and α = 1.6 for years 1996 and 2004, respectively, will become clear shortly). One has to keep in mind that the other values of this quantity can lead to the different results and to better or worse agreement between the model and real data. We can use this observation to select the most probable value of α and to analyse the behaviour of the distance coefficient in time. As mentioned in the introduction, this behaviour can be strictly related with the progress of the globalization process in the context of transportation networks. Thus, analysing changes of the distance coefficient would provide another indicator of the rate of the global integration.\nFor every year in the analysed period 1990-2011, we have created the histograms of empirical and modelled flows, P ( f ij ) and P ( f ij mcf )( α ), respectively, in m = 15 logarithmically spaced bins. The examples of such normalized histograms for year 1996 are presented in Fig. 4b. As one can see, the histograms P ( f ij mcf )( α ) created for different values of the α parameter differ in agreement with the histogram of empirical flows (marked by the shaded grey area). To measure this agreement, ∆ ( α ), we use a simple RMS formula\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nIn Fig. 4a, we show how this quality measure, ∆ ( α ), depends on the parameter α in the year 1996. The clearly visible minimum at α = 1.5 indicates the correct value of the distance coefficient in this year.\nFigure 5 demonstrates the behaviour of the distance coefficient for the years 1990-2011 retrieved by this method. The general conclusion that follows from the figure is that the distance effect in air transportation network is constant over time and the globalization process, which is reflected in the distance coefficient has been stabilized in the XXI century. This conclusion confirms the other results (presented by the grey circles in Fig. 5) obtained in ref. 17, where the authors estimated the distance coefficient for the international trade network.\nNow, let us shortly analyse the major fluctuations around this constant distance coefficient. In Fig. 5, we have marked three historical events that could influence the behaviour of the distance coefficient in the same way as they had an impact on the whole aviation industry. Attacks in New York and Washington D.C. in September of 2001 started a chain of events such as SARS epidemic, additional terrorist attempts, wars, and rising oil prices, that cost the airline industry three years of growth. Airline revenues and traffic surpassed 2000 levels only in 2004 19 . The 2008 global financial crisis costed another several years of growth. The effect was further enhanced by the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland in 2010 that caused the closure of airspace over many countries. The correlation between the distance coefficient and all these events, shown in Fig. 5, confirms that they have a negative impact not only on airline revenues or air traffic but on the whole globalization process.\nFigure 4. ( a ) Example of the agreement measure ∆ ( α ) calculated for different values of parameter α in the year 1996. The arrows show the values for which three histograms P ( f ij mcf )( α ) are shown in panel ( b ). Grey shaded area represents the histogram P ( f ij ) characterizing real data.\nFigure 5. The year-by-year values of the distance coefficient α for the air transportation network resulting from the minimalization of the measure ∆ ( α ) (black squares) and for the world trade network taken from a previous paper 17 (grey circles).\nIt should be noted that the globalization process is sometimes conceptualized as a continuous reduction in the effective distance in the world 20 , which means that the distance coefficient should vanish in time.
