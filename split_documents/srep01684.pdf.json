We use Google Trends to determine howmanysearches n(t 1 ) have been carried out for a specific search term such as debt in week t 1, where Google defines weeks as ending on a Sunday, relative to the total number of searches carried out on Google during that time. We find that search volume data change slightly over time due to Google 's extraction procedure. For each search term, we therefore average over three realizations of its search volume time series, based on three independent data requests in consecutive weeks. The variability of Google Trends data across different dates of access is irrelevant for our results, and it can be shown that the data are consistent with reported real world events (see Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Information ).\nToquantify changes in information gathering behavior, we use the relative change in search volume: D n(t, D t) 5 n(t) 2 N(t 2 1 , D t) with N(t 2 1 , D t) 5 (n(t 2 1 ) 1 n(t 2 2 ) 1 ... 1 n(t 2 D t))/ D t , where t is measured in units of weeks.

If instead D n(t 2 1 , D t) , 0 , then we buy the DJIA at the closing price p(t) on the first trading day of week t and sell the DJIA at price p(t 1 1) at the end of the first trading day of the coming week. At the beginning of trading, we set the value of all portfolios to an arbitrary value of 1. If we take a 'short position'-selling at the closing price p(t) and buying back at price p(t 1 1 ) -then the cumulative return R changes by log( p(t) ) 2 log( p(t 1 1 ) ). If we take a 'long position'-buying at the closing price p(t) and selling at price p(t 1 1 ) -then the cumulative return R changes by log( p(t 1 1 ) ) 2 log( p(t) ). In this way, buy and sell actions have symmetric impacts on the cumulative return R of a strategy's portfolio. In using this approach to analyze the relationship between Google search volume and stock market movements, we neglect transaction fees, since the maximum number of transactions per year when using our strategy is only 104, allowing a closing and an opening transaction per week.

        "text": "Highlights the significant outperformance of Google Trends strategies based on U.S. search volume data compared to random investment strategies, demonstrating a clear correlation between search volume changes and stock market movements.\n\nFigure 3 | Performances of investment strategies based on search volume data. ( A ) Cumulative returns of 98 investment strategies based on search volumes restricted to search requests of users located in the United States for different search terms, displayed for the entire time period of our study from 5 January 2004 until 22 February 2011-the time period for which Google Trends provides data. We use two shades of blue for positive returns and two shades of red for negative returns to improve the readability of the search terms. The cumulative performance for the ''buy and hold strategy'' is also shown, as is a ''Dow Jones strategy'', which uses weekly closing prices of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rather than Google Trends data (see gray bars). Figures provided next to the bars indicate the returns of a strategy, R , in standard deviations from the mean return of uncorrelated random investment strategies, , R . RandomStrategy 5 0. Dashed lines correspond to 2 3, 2 2, 2 1, 0, 1 1, 1 2, and 1 3 standard deviations of random strategies. We find that returns from the Google Trends strategies tested are significantly higher overall than returns from the random strategies ( , R . US 5 0.60; t 5 8.65, df 5 97, p , 0.001, one sample t-test). ( B ) A parallel analysis shows that extending the range of the search volume analysis to global users reduces the overall return achieved by Google Trends trading strategies on the U.S. market ( , R . US 5 0.60, , R . Global 5 0.43; t 5 2.69, df 5 97, p , 0.01, two-sided paired t-test). However, returns are still significantly higher than the mean return of random investment strategies ( , R . Global 5 0.43; t 5 6.40, df 5 97, p , 0.001, one sample t-test).\nA\nFigure 4 | Analysis using strategies in which we take long or short positions only, using U.S. search volume data. ( A ) We implement Google Trends strategies in which we take long positions following a decrease in search volume, and never take short positions. We find that returns from these long position Google Trends strategies are significantly higher overall than returns from the random investment strategies ( , R . USLong 5 0.41; t 5 11.42, df 5 97, p , 0.001, one sample t-test). Again, we find a positive correlation between our indicator of financial relevance and returns from these strategies (Kendall's tau 5 0.242, z 5 3.53, N 5 98, p , 0.001). ( B ) We also implement Google Trends strategies in which we take short positions following an increase in search volume, and never take long positions. In line with our results from the long position Google Trends strategies, we find that returns from the short position Google Trends strategies are significantly higher overall than returns from the random investment strategies ( , R . USShort 5 0.19; t 5 5.28, df 5 97, p , 0.001, one sample t-test), and that there is a positive correlation between our indicator of financial relevance and short position Google Trends returns (Kendall's tau 5 0.275, z 5 4.01, N 5 98, p , 0.001).\nperformance of Google Trends strategies based on all other search terms that we analyze is depicted in Figures S3-S100 in the Supplementary Information .\nWe rank the full list of the 98 investigated search terms by their trading performance when using search data for U.S. users only (Fig. 3A) and when using globally generated search volume (Fig. 3B). In order to ensure the robustness of our results, the overall performance of a strategy based on a given search term is determined as the mean value over the six returns obtained for D t 5 1 . . . 6 weeks. Returns of the strategies are calculated as the logarithm of relative portfolio changes, following the usual definition of returns. The distribution of final portfolio values resulting from the random investment strategies is close to log-normal. Cumulative returns from the random investment strategy, derived from the logarithm of these portfolio values, therefore follow a normal distribution, with a mean value of , R . RandomStrategy 5 0. Here we report R, the cumulative returns of a strategy , in standard deviations of the cumulative returns of these uncorrelated random investment strategies.\nWe find that returns from the Google Trends strategies we tested are significantly higher overall than returns from the random strategies ( , R . US 5 0.60; t 5 8.65, df 5 97, p , 0.001, one sample t-test).\nWe compare the performance of these search terms with two benchmark strategies. The 'buy and hold' strategy is implemented by buying the index in the beginning and selling it at the end of the hold period. This strategy yields 16% profit, equal to the overall increase in value of the DJIA in the time period from January 2004 until February 2011. We further implement a ' DowJones strategy' by using changes in p(t) in place of changes in search volume data as the basis of buy and sell decisions. We find that this strategy also yields only 33% profit with D t 5 3 weeks, or when determined as the mean value over the six returns obtained for D t 5 1 . . . 6 weeks, 0.45 standard deviations of cumulative returns of uncorrelated random investment strategies (Figs. 3A and 3B; see also Fig. S101 in the Supplementary Information ).\nOur results show that performance of the Google Trends strategy differs with the search term chosen. We investigate whether these differences in performance can be partially explained using an indicator of the extent to which different terms are of financial relevance-a concept we quantify by calculating the frequency of each search term in the online edition of the Financial Times from August 2004 to June 2011, normalized by the number of Google hits for each search term (see Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Information). Wefind that the return associated with a given search term is correlated with this indicator of financial relevance (Kendall's tau 5 0.275, z 5 4.01, N 5 98, p , 0.001) using Kendall's tau rank correlation coefficient 37 .\nIt is widely recognized that investors prefer to trade on their domestic market, suggesting that search data for U.S. users only, as used in analyses so far, should better capture the information gathering behavior of U.S. stock market participants than data for Google users worldwide. Indeed, we find that strategies based on global search volume data are less successful than strategies based on U.S. search volume data in anticipating movements of the U.S. market ( , R . US 5 0.60, , R . Global 5 0.43; t 5 2.69, df 5 97, p , 0.01, two-sided paired t-test).\nOur empirical results so far are consistent with a two part hypothesis: namely that key increases in the price of the DJIA were preceded by a decrease in search volume for certain financially related terms, and conversely, that key decreases in the price of the DJIA were preceded by an increase in search volume for certain financially related terms. However, our trading strategy can be decomposed into two strategy components: one in which a decrease in search volume prompts us to buy (or take a long position) and one in which an increase in search volume prompts us to sell (or take a short position).\nIn order to verify that both strategy components play a significant role in our results, such that we have evidence for both parts of this hypothesis, we implement and test one strategy in which we take long positions following a decrease in search volume but never take short positions (Fig. 4A), and another strategy in which we take short positions following an increase in search volume but never take long positions (Fig. 4B). We find that returns from both Google Trends strategy components are significantly higher overall than returns from a random investment strategy (long position strategies: , R . USLong 5 0.41; t 5 11.42, df 5 97, p , 0.001, one sample t-test; short position strategies: , R . USShort 5 0.19; t 5 5.28, df 5 97, p , 0.001, one sample t-test).",

US 5 0.60; t 5 8.65, df 5 97, p , 0.001, one sample t-test).\nWe compare the performance of these search terms with two benchmark strategies. The 'buy and hold' strategy is implemented by buying the index in the beginning and selling it at the end of the hold period. This strategy yields 16% profit, equal to the overall increase in value of the DJIA in the time period from January 2004 until February 2011. We further implement a ' DowJones strategy' by using changes in p(t) in place of changes in search volume data as the basis of buy and sell decisions. We find that this strategy also yields only 33% profit with D t 5 3 weeks, or when determined as the mean value over the six returns obtained for D t 5 1 . . . 6 weeks, 0.45 standard deviations of cumulative returns of uncorrelated random investment strategies (Figs. 3A and 3B; see also Fig. S101 in the Supplementary Information ).\nOur results show that performance of the Google Trends strategy differs with the search term chosen. We investigate whether these differences in performance can be partially explained using an indicator of the extent to which different terms are of financial relevance-a concept we quantify by calculating the frequency of each search term in the online edition of the Financial Times from August 2004 to June 2011, normalized by the number of Google hits for each search term (see Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Information). Wefind that the return associated with a given search term is correlated with this indicator of financial relevance (Kendall's tau 5 0.275, z 5 4.01, N 5 98, p , 0.001) using Kendall's tau rank correlation coefficient 37 .\nIt is widely recognized that investors prefer to trade on their domestic market, suggesting that search data for U.S. users only, as used in analyses so far, should better capture the information gathering behavior of U.S. stock market participants than data for Google users worldwide. Indeed, we find that strategies based on global search volume data are less successful than strategies based on U.S. search volume data in anticipating movements of the U.S. market ( , R . US 5 0.60, , R . Global 5 0.43; t 5 2.69, df 5 97, p , 0.01, two-sided paired t-test).\nOur empirical results so far are consistent with a two part hypothesis: namely that key increases in the price of the DJIA were preceded by a decrease in search volume for certain financially related terms, and conversely, that key decreases in the price of the DJIA were preceded by an increase in search volume for certain financially related terms. However, our trading strategy can be decomposed into two strategy components: one in which a decrease in search volume prompts us to buy (or take a long position) and one in which an increase in search volume prompts us to sell (or take a short position).\nIn order to verify that both strategy components play a significant role in our results, such that we have evidence for both parts of this hypothesis, we implement and test one strategy in which we take long positions following a decrease in search volume but never take short positions (Fig. 4A), and another strategy in which we take short positions following an increase in search volume but never take long positions (Fig. 4B). We find that returns from both Google Trends strategy components are significantly higher overall than returns from a random investment strategy (long position strategies: , R . USLong 5 0.41; t 5 11.42, df 5 97, p , 0.001, one sample t-test; short position strategies: , R . USShort 5 0.19; t 5 5.28, df 5 97, p , 0.001, one sample t-test).",
