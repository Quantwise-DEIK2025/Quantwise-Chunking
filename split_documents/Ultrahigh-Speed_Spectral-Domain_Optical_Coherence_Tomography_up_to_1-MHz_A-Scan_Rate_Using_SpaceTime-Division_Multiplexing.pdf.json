To overcome this drawback, the Fourier-domain OCT (FD-OCT) was developed to directly obtain depthresolved spectra without unnecessary movement of mirror and with an improved system sensitivity [16], [17]. Swept-source OCT (SS-OCT) is one of the FD-OCT methods, which has a sufficient imaging speed and detects the spectrum of each wavelength by a photodetector that is mainly influenced by the sweeping rate of the wavelength-tunable light source [18], [19], whereas SS-OCT systems with an MHz high A-scan rate have been presented in previous reports [20]-[22]. Although SS-OCT provides the reduced sensitivity roll-off and high-speed A-scan rate [16], [23], axial resolution is slightly degraded, because of the longer wavelength of the source, and the cost of development is expansive compared to spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) [24], [25].\nSD-OCT is a widely applied and comparatively economical imaging technique with an exceptional resolution. However, the low speed of the detector has a direct negative impact on the system speed [26]. Thus, multiple attempts were made to enhance the system speed, where those studies are mainly focused on shortening the integration time of the line-scan camera, which needs to sacrifice the detectable maximum number of detector pixels [27]. To further improve the A-line rate, multiple line-scan cameras were used, and their operating times were conversely controlled to use the dead time for capturing [26], [27]. Based on this method, a 1-MHz A-line rate SD-OCT system was developed using four separate cameras [28]. However, the conventional multicamerabased system requires multiple independent spectrometers as much as a number of line-scan cameras, causing inevitable errors of spectrum difference at each spectrometer [26]-[28]. In addition, optical demultiplexer-based FD-OCT, which is used as a spectral analyzer, was introduced to further improve\nthe scanning speed up to multi-MHz [29], [30]. Nevertheless, the interference spectrum is diffracted by the limited channels of the demultiplexer, which attenuates the signal and decreases the resolution of frequency interval [29]. Moreover, multiple data acquisition (DAQ) boards and digitizers are required to improve the speed, leading to an increase in the total system prices of optical demultiplexer-based OCT [30].\nAs an alternative approach to enhancing the speed, the MHz streak-mode OCT, which utilizes an area-scan camera with a resonant scanner in the spectrometer to extend the integration time, was proposed. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is much degraded compared with the conventional OCT, whereas nonuniformed exposure of the camera reduces the utilization of the duty cycle as well [31]. In addition, a parallel-OCT-based high-speed system, which improves the illumination power by applying a line focus to the sample, was reported in [32] and [33]. However, the limitations of sensitivity and imaging depth were nonnegligible [32], [34]. Moreover, as an alternative method for improving the scanning rate, multispatial scanning method-based OCT was developed, which utilized wavelength filters to split the beam of the sample arm; however, the axial resolution was reduced because of a higher number of scanning channel [35]. In addition, the space-division multiplexing (SDM) OCT, which illuminates the sample with multiple imaging beams with different optical delays, was also demonstrated [36], [37].\nIn this study, we developed ultrahigh-speed SD-OCT by optimizing the A-line rate up to 1 MHz, which was achieved by space-time-division multiplexing (STDM). To precisely synchronize the operating time and improve the processing speed, a control software platform was developed using C ++ with the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). The system performance, as an aspect of SDM, was quantitatively evaluated by sensitivity roll-off of each camera, and cross-sectional images were obtained. In addition, the time-division multiplexing (TDM) method, which improves the operating speed and minimizes the alignment error, was verified by the A-scan profiling results of the image-merging process. Moreover, to verify the capability of high-speed STDM-OCT for industrial applications, laboratory-customized subsurface structures of multilayered optical thin films (OTFs) were examined. Therefore, the demonstrated high-speed SD-OCT system has a potential for various applications, where high-speed scanning is essential, such as clinical and biomedical research areas.",

Details the synchronization method using a main trigger and scanner signals to achieve a 1 MHz A-line rate through TDM.\n\nThe developed software algorithm used for STDM-OCT is presented in Fig. 2(a). The developed custom control programming platform is built using C ++ , CUDA, and Qt. Before the initiation of optical scanning, parameter setting and initialization process, in which the scanning mode was selected and the range was matched to the properties of the sample, were performed. In addition, memories are automatically allocated according to previously initiated values. After the initialization stage, the STDM-OCT engine operation is initiated simultaneously with optical scanning and camera acquisition. The acquired raw signal is transferred to the graphics processing unit (GPU) (from host memory to GPU memory) and processed via the CUDA-based signal processing stage, which includes k-domain linearization, the fast Fourier transform, and log scaling. Through the GPU acceleration, data transmission, processing, and displaying process are properly operated in real-time without buffer overflow. After completing the signal processing of the obtained data in one cycle of x-galvo on GPU, the status of the engine (B-mode completed) is transferred and updated to the user interface (UI) via the callback function in the application programming interface (API). When the UI receives the B-mode completed signal, it starts the 'Get image' process by utilizing a callback function in the API for a memory copy of processed data in the OCT engine and displays the image. According to the API-based source code design, precise status synchronization and highly efficient source code management were achieved by loose coupling between the UI and OCT engine.\nTo control the hardware compositions in order to successfully achieve a 1-MHz A-line rate, synchronization with precise triggering is essentially required. The working sequence is represented by the main trigger, signals of two scanners, and two cameras, as presented in Fig. 2(b). To initiate the starting signal from UI, the DAQ board generates the main trigger, which ensures synchronized timing of the start of implementation. The operations of both scanners and frame grabbers are started simultaneously at the rising edge of the main trigger.\nTo enhance the speed of STDM-OCT, the SDM method, which simultaneously operates the multiscanners, was implemented. Although two sample arms were composed separately, the x -axis and y -axis galvo scanners of each sample arm were controlled similarly with an equal timing by triangular and square waves. Since the raster scanning method was applied to STDM-OCT, the x -axis scanner bidirectionally scans, while the y -axis scanner moves one step in synchronization at the end of each direction (shown in Fig. 2(b) as forward scanning and backward scanning). The path lengths of each scanner were precisely controlled to multiplex the dual scanning data in a single imaging depth. In the case of frame grabbers, identical but reversed trigger sequences of 250 kHz with 50% duty cycle were transferred to each camera to fully utilize the duty cycle without a dead time, which is called TDM in the proposed scheme. Therefore, two continuous A-lines were captured in one period of camera trigger; it guarantees 500 kHz of the effective imaging rate, which is twice faster than the maximum sampling rate of the line-scan camera. These captured A-lines of each camera were alternately composed of B-scan images. Therefore, the speed of STDM-OCT was further increased to 1 MHz by successfully implementing the integrated STDM method.",

These captured A-lines of each camera were alternately composed of B-scan images. Therefore, the speed of STDM-OCT was further increased to 1 MHz by successfully implementing the integrated STDM method.",

In addition, each value of measured sensitivity was shown in Table I as well. Since the developed single spectrometer consists of two line-scan cameras using a beam splitter to identically divide the coherent signal for each detector, the measured sensitivity roll-off values of the two independently detected signals confirmed the almost equivalent performance. The averaged sensitivity difference between the two cameras is 2.5 dB, and the measured peak sensitivities (at the 100th pixel) were 139 and 137 dB, respectively. To demonstrate the degree of image quality degradation in th depth direction, B-scan images of IR-card were obtained, which are shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d) while varying depth position from the zero-path delay to 2.6 mm. The measured pixel range of B-scan images in the depth direction was distinguished by edge colors (red and blue).

In addition, the scanning ranges of each scanner used for SDM are indicated by edge color and color bar (red and blue) in Fig. 7(a). As presented in Fig. 7(b)-(f), the layer structure of the OTF is well distinguished at every measuring position (L1-L5) during the whole-range scanning of the sample. Therefore, these results reveal that the STDM-OCT with a 1-MHz A-line rate is feasible for industrial applications, ensuring high accuracy and reliable quality with a minimum inspection time.",

        "text": "Highlights the feasibility of the ultrahigh-speed STDM-OCT system for industrial applications, emphasizing its cost-effectiveness and performance improvements compared to conventional multi-camera systems.\n\nHere, we demonstrated the SD-OCT of a 1-MHz A-line rate and introduced a single-spectrometer-based STDM method. Various approaches to enhance imaging speed have been keenly studied and demonstrated. Compared with the conventional method of using a multiple-camera-based system [28], the proposed STDM-OCT of the current research not only resolves the alignment difference error of each spectrometer but also minimizes power loss and effectively economizes the total cost of the system (single-spectrometer-based system configuration). Furthermore, STDM-OCT partially provides enhanced SNR, sensitivity (more than 130 dB), and imaging depth (more than 4 mm) with cost-effective development in comparison with the optical demultiplexer-based method [29], [30], the streak-mode OCT [31], and the parallel OCT [32], [34]. In addition, as an aspect of system price, which is a factor to broaden applications of OCT, SD-OCT has obvious merit compared to SS-OCT. Based on this fact, the developed STDM-OCT provides a 1-MHz A-scan rate, which reduces the inspection time, with comparably low cost to develop compared to SS-OCT. Furthermore, SS-OCT provides a high-speed A-scan rate; however, to the best of our knowledge, the maximum sweeping rate of the commercial swept source is up to 400 kHz, which can be sufficiently obtained by the developed STDM-OCT.\nIn the case of the SDM method applied to STDM-OCT, two scanners were separately used, where the path lengths were differently maintained to ensure a wide scanning range of the OTF sample. However, single-scanner-based conventional SDM can also be applied to match the sample properties. As an aspect of 3-D volumetric imaging by integrating GPU parallel processing with the STDM method, 8 vol/s for 250 × 250 × 2048 pixels (9 × 4.5 × 5 mm) was achieved, which covers a much wider scanning range maintaining a high speed compared with the conventional real-time SD-OCT systems [39]-[41]. Furthermore, the volume rate of STDM-OCT can be freely adjusted according to experimental conditions, such as 2 vol/s for 16 × 8 × 5 mm and 0.5 vol/s for 30 × 16 × 5 mm. In addition, the scanning speed and range can be further increased by applying a multiple-STDM method, which employs additional scanners and cameras. Since we applied GPU acceleration, signal processing and displaying (including cross-sectional images and extracted each scanner's en face images) are processed in real time. Only when the image save process is proceeded, displaying B-scan images are updated with preset interval, as shown in Video 2 in the Supplementary Material, while signal processing and saving are processed in real time. In addition, each scanner's spliced B-scan images can be obtained by applying our extracting method described in [42].\nHere, a customized OTF was chosen as a sample to confirm the feasibility of the presented ultrahigh-speed OCT system\nin industrial applications for the measurement of the final product to inspect the cracks, which causes huge losses and damage to the product. As an aspect of the thickness of the sample, the path length of the reference arm is adjustable to match the focal point without overlapping each scanner's pixel position. Based on the obtained results, STDM-OCT demonstrates the possibility of applying to various fields, which requires high-speed systems, including industrial product manufacturing and inspecting, such as ultrathin glass ( ∼ 100 μ m), polarizer ( ∼ 300 μ m), glass substrate ( ∼ 500 μ m), OTF ( ∼ 700 μ m), and light guide plate ( ∼ 1 mm), which are within an imaging range of the proposed system (4.4 mm) and even biomedical applications. Furthermore, the successful utilization of higher-speed data-transferring techniques and processing techniques and faster line-scan cameras can further enhance the speed of the system beyond the developed 1-MHz\nA-scan rate.",
