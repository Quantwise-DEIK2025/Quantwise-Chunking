Moreover, distribution shapes are also quite different, for each LER parameter. For those reasons, the mixture of MVNs was used to deal with the non-ideal cases. A conceptual diagram for the mixture of MVNs is shown in Fig. 3.\nTo determine the number of components (i.e., MVN distributions) used in generating the mixture of MVNs, an optimization was GLYPH<28>rst done. V alidation datasets were used in the training process, to GLYPH<28>nd the best working model. In Fig. 4, it can be noted that the validation loss was minimized with the number of components of 11 at 7,800 epochs. This means that the ANN model with 11 MVNs works best to describe the distribution of performance metrics. The optimized ANN with the mixture of MVNs has 3 neurons for the input layer, 81 neurons for the GLYPH<28>rst hidden layer, 162 neurons for the second hidden layer, 324 for the third hidden layer, and 324 neurons for the output layer. This output neurons are\nFIGURE 4. Validation loss vs. the number of epochs, when the number of distribution used to mixture is varied from 9 to 13.\nFIGURE 5.
