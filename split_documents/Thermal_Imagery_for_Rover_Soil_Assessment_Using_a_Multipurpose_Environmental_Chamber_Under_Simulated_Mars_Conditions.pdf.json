In this sense, infrared (IR) remote sensors such as thermopiles and thermal cameras have provided relevant data to infer subsurface properties, as the thermal behavior of the surface is influenced by the composition of deeper soil layers [9]. Thus, soil composition can be remotely inferred by estimating the soil thermal inertia, which is the key material property that affects the surface thermal behavior, over daily cycles of temperature variations [10]. Thermopiles are being actively used in the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers to perform measurements of Martian surface thermal behavior to assess the geophysical properties of areas of interest. Remote temperature measurements taken during their traverses have been employed to infer the thermal inertia of several types of soils not only for scientific purposes [11], [12] but also for rover slip prediction [13].

As pointed out in [13], the Spirit rover could have avoided getting trapped in the sand if a thermal camera had been used to assess the duricrust-covered sandy area by contrasting thermal inertia because, unlike visual surface appearance, this physical phenomenon is directly correlated to properties such as particle size, soil cohesion, porosity, and bedrock abundance, which are essential for vehicle slippage prevention and safe mobility.\nThermal inertia represents a combination of physical properties that are not directly measurable in practice, so simplified estimations based on surface temperature observations (either from satellite measurements or on-site data) are required. Thermal inertia can be estimated by fitting the measured thermal daily cycles with the temperature obtained from a surface thermal model, which entails solving numerical models by iterating the values of several unknown parameters until the model's curve fits the measurements [19]. Alternatively, the apparent thermal inertia (ATI) [20] allows a simpler computation, but it does not consider the surface net heat flux. In this work, we use a method based on the daily amplitude of surface net heat flux and temperature to calculate the thermal inertia of a surface subjected to the Sun's heating [21].\nSatellite-based measurements of thermal inertia have provided a means to determine the physical properties of the Earth's surface on a global scale, which would be impractical to obtain through on-site measurements [20], [22]. Similarly, satellite measurements of the Martian surface have been helpful to identify potential areas of scientific interest for future exploration [23], [24]. Satellite measurements, although valuable for large-scale assessments, often lack the required resolution for robotic navigation and can be influenced by clouds and other atmospheric conditions.\nAs for on-site measurements, the deployment of thermopiles on Mars rovers has been used to identify soil characteristics of traversed paths at higher resolution than satellites by acquiring diurnal cycle measurements [25], [26]. The Curiosity rover uses the ground temperature sensor (GTS), positioned at a height of 1.6 m, with a downward-looking field of view (FOV) covering 100 m 2 of terrain [27]. Furthermore, the Perseverance rover features the thermal IR sensor (TIRS), a combination of five thermopiles, one of which measures ground temperature from a height of 1.5 m with an FOV of approximately 3 m 2 [28]. Nonetheless, 1-D IR sensors such as thermopiles offer insufficient resolution to distinguish between adjacent heterogeneous soil regions [13].\nCurrent rover missions already incorporate multispectral 2-D cameras for narrowband visible/near-IR (VNIR) for mineralogical measurements [18], [29], but long-wave IR (LWIR) imagery is needed for thermal behavior assessment. On Earth, on-site thermal cameras have been employed to estimate diurnal thermal inertia of different soils, even if results were limited by the effect of Earth pressure [30], [31].\nFurther development on planetary soil assessment with LWIR cameras is hindered by the lack of actual thermal images from Mars rovers [32]. This is especially critical in view of the rapid development of machine learning methods, which demand large amounts of training measurements [33], [34], [35]. This problem has been addressed by creating synthetic Martian data using generative neural networks [36].\nParticularly, synthetic IR Martian images for thermal inertia estimation were generated from a multimodal combination of Earth data, including RGB imagery [32]. Alternatively, more accurate planetary conditions such as pressure and atmospheric composition can be physically simulated in MECs. For instance, JPL developed a large facility for the simulation of intense solar radiation in interplanetary vacuum conditions [14]. More recently, a small-scale MEC was developed to simulate planetary pressure and temperature conditions for testing instrumentation, procedures, and materials, called SpaceQ [15]. Moreover, the Mars MECs in [16] and [17] are used for VNIR and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) measurements.

Subsurface temperature data was limited to equatorial soils for one soil per experiment pair. The experiments involved simulating Martian atmospheric composition (95% CO2) and sinusoidal temperature cycles. Surface temperatures were measured using a thermal camera, assuming emissivity and albedo of 1 for all soils, and the data is used to calculate thermal inertia.\n\nTwo sets of experiments, namely, pair-1 and pair-2, were conducted within the MEC using the soils specified in Table I to ensure redundancy in measurements. These experiment pairs encompassed conditions representing Earth-standard pressure (1000 mbar) (1 and 3) as well as Mars-like pressure (8 mbar) (2 and 4). Table II provides an overview of the key characteristics of each experiment. Due to limitations in MEC connectivity, subsurface temperature data could only be equatorial for one of the soils on each experiment. For pair-1 and pair-2, the subsurface thermocouple gauge was positioned at a depth of 3 cm in soils A and C, respectively.\nDuring the Mars-like experiments, the MEC was filled with air matching Mars' carbon dioxide (CO2) atmospheric composition (i.e., 95%). Environmental measurements taken near the equatorial region on Mars by the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) indicated mean daily air temperatures around -50 ◦ C with approximate amplitudes of 60 ◦ C [41]. Thus, sinusoidal temperatures of similar amplitude were simulated in diurnal cycles of experimental actuation period Pe by manual input of constant heating and cooling setpoints for MEC actuation.\nSoil surface temperatures were measured by means of the Optris PI-640i thermal camera. The measurements were made assuming no prior knowledge of the soils, as would be the case in actual rover soil assessment implementations. Thus, emissivity ( ε ) was considered to be unitary and the albedo ( A ) to be zero for all the soils, according to Kirchhoff's law: 1 = A + ε [42]. Polygonal areas delimiting each soil were defined in the acquired thermal images, with the pixels containing the thermocouple gauge being excluded to avoid affecting temperature measurements.\nFigs. 7-10 show the diurnal cycle temperatures for all soil types from Experiments 1-4, respectively. Besides, Figs. 11 and 12 present surface and subsurface temperature readings for soil A (Experiments 1 and 2) and soil C (Experiments 3 and 4), respectively. All the figures display the heater, setpoint, and air temperatures. The transient phase is considered to conclude once an inflection point is reached in the rising heater temperature response.\nTable III provides the mean soil surface temperatures for the pixels within the corresponding polygonal area, along with the standard deviations for the four experiments.

T tran denotes the standard deviation temperature for each soil when the actuation transient phase concludes. The net heat fluxes were calculated by applying the surface energy budget equation for each sample bin within the MEC, as described in (6). This computation used the mean temperatures of the soils and the MEC heater temperatures recorded during the experiments. Additionally, the increase in net heat flux during the experiments was determined as 1 Gs = G max -G init, where G max represents the maximum net heat flux and G init is the net heat flux at the beginning of the actuation. The thermal inertia estimates in (5), denoted as I sin , were calculated based on the values of 1 Ts , 1 Gs , and Pe obtained during the experiments.",

Thus, sinusoidal temperatures of similar amplitude were simulated in diurnal cycles of experimental actuation period Pe by manual input of constant heating and cooling setpoints for MEC actuation.\nSoil surface temperatures were measured by means of the Optris PI-640i thermal camera. The measurements were made assuming no prior knowledge of the soils, as would be the case in actual rover soil assessment implementations. Thus, emissivity ( ε ) was considered to be unitary and the albedo ( A ) to be zero for all the soils, according to Kirchhoff's law: 1 = A + ε [42]. Polygonal areas delimiting each soil were defined in the acquired thermal images, with the pixels containing the thermocouple gauge being excluded to avoid affecting temperature measurements.\nFigs. 7-10 show the diurnal cycle temperatures for all soil types from Experiments 1-4, respectively. Besides, Figs. 11 and 12 present surface and subsurface temperature readings for soil A (Experiments 1 and 2) and soil C (Experiments 3 and 4), respectively. All the figures display the heater, setpoint, and air temperatures. The transient phase is considered to conclude once an inflection point is reached in the rising heater temperature response.\nTable III provides the mean soil surface temperatures for the pixels within the corresponding polygonal area, along with the standard deviations for the four experiments. In this table, 1 Ts = T max -T init , where T max represents the maximum\nFig. 7. Diurnal cycle temperatures for Experiment 1 at Earth's pressure ( p = 1000 mbar). (a) Mean temperature.

T tran denotes the standard deviation temperature for each soil when the actuation transient phase concludes. The net heat fluxes were calculated by applying the surface energy budget equation for each sample bin within the MEC, as described in (6). This computation used the mean temperatures of the soils and the MEC heater temperatures recorded during the experiments. Additionally, the increase in net heat flux during the experiments was determined as 1 Gs = G max -G init, where G max represents the maximum net heat flux and G init is the net heat flux at the beginning of the actuation. The thermal inertia estimates in (5), denoted as I sin , were calculated based on the values of 1 Ts , 1 Gs , and Pe obtained during the experiments.",

Subsurface temperature data was limited to equatorial soils for one soil per experiment pair. The experiments involved simulating Martian atmospheric composition (95% CO2) and sinusoidal temperature cycles. Surface temperatures were measured using a thermal camera, assuming emissivity and albedo of 1 for all soils, and the data is used to calculate thermal inertia.",
