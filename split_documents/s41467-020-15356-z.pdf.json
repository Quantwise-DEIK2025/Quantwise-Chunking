Here, against this background, we focus on the intensity of self-organizing processes arising from stock returns ' co-movements and self-similarities.\nInspired by H.A. Simon ' s near decomposability condition 20 to represent a stable system con /uniFB01 guration 21 -23 , we hypothesize that, during instability phases, a sub-graph of stocks displays increasing co-movements and self-similarity patterns, which we propose to quantify by means of the Pearson ' s correlation coef /uniFB01 cient (PCC) and the autocovariance (AC) of stock returns (see Supplementary information, Section 3.1). We refer to this sub-graph of stocks as the leading temporal module (LTM) of the system, whose dynamics is anticipatory for the whole underlying system. In particular, when the system is approaching a change in its equilibrium con /uniFB01 guration, we observe that the absolute value of the average PCC is increasing within the set of stocks composing the LTM sub-graph, but decreasing between stocks belonging to the LTM and stocks outside the LTM group, while the average AC of stocks within the LTM is increasing.\nA rigorous investigation of the properties of the LTM, based on its temporal and spatial dimensions, allows us to build a synthetic and /uniFB02 exible indicator, which we use to detect the emergence of signi /uniFB01 cant changes in the underlying /uniFB01 nancial market. We propose a parsimonious aggregate indicator based on the mean absolute value of the AC of the stocks belonging to the LTM ( < j AC LTM t j > ) and on the ratio between the correlations of stocks within the LTM ( < j PCC LTM t j > ) and the correlations of stocks outside the leading module ( < j PCC f LTM t j > ).

Hence, the LTM identi /uniFB01 cation is performed within the set of stocks for which the DFA indicates the presence of long-range memory. For comparison purposes, we also verify the predictive properties of both the set of stocks that have a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant DFA, but are not in the LTM sub-graph (namely, DFA -) and the ones not selected by neither the DFA nor the LTM procedures (indicated as Rest).\nTo mimic the possible system dynamics far and near a transition point, we also employ a Lotka -Volterra model of stocks dynamics (see Supplementary information, Section 3.3). Speci /uniFB01 -cally, we simulate the system with different values of the bifurcation parameter and then we compute the statistical components of our proposed indicator. We note that while far from transition the time series exhibit small correlations and relatively low ACs, close to the bifurcation point the series exhibit both higher ACs and stronger correlation values.\nFinally, we implement an illustrative investment strategy that builds on the identi /uniFB01 cation of the emergence of up and down market phases 31,32 to show the functioning of our approach. Our analysis thus contributes to the understanding of /uniFB01 nancial markets by studying how the effects of linkages at the micro-level turn out to be relevant at the macro-level in the corresponding aggregate system. In fact, at the micro-level investors interact through heterogeneous allocation strategies, adapting their behavior in response to the performance of their investments, the arrival of new information, and the interplay of social interactions and observations, which generate, at the macro-level, non-trivial aggregate patterns of the corresponding /uniFB01 nancial system 13,33 -40 .

In our approach, the LTM can be viewed as analogous to the nucleus of the new phase for /uniFB01 nancial markets.

We analyze the stocks referring to the STOXX Asia/Paci /uniFB01 c 600 Index, which is a broad and liquid subset of the STOXX Global 1800 Index. We investigate the dynamics of the aggregate index starting from the micro-level represented by the stocks that approximately constitute it. We employ daily closure prices along the period 2006 -2017 to compute the corresponding returns at the ground of the analysis. During the period of our analysis, the Asian stock market experienced unstable dynamics, with large booms and bursts. These up and down swings re /uniFB02 ect the 2008 global /uniFB01 nancial crisis /uniFB01 rstly, and, more recently, the real estate bubble and the /uniFB02 ood of debt by municipal governments and local enterprises designed to fund infrastructure investments 45 -48 . We also provide additional evidence on stocks constituting the STOXX North America 600 Index (see Supplementary information, Section 3.7).\nThe dynamics of the LTM sub-graph identi /uniFB01 es market phases characterized by the strengthening of price co-movements\nFig. 1 The leading temporal module (LTM) sub-graph in different market phases together with the indicator I LTM t reported against the market\ndynamics. a , b show the absolute value of the correlation matrices (PCC) derived from stocks returns, emphasizing the LTM sub-graph with a red square, together with the absolute average auto-covariance (AAC) computed on both its members and on the rest of the system. Correlation matrices and autocovariance are displayed for two different market phases, centered around 08-06-2009 in a and around 21-04-2010 in b , which stand for an unstable and a business as usual phase, respectively. c illustrates the sets of stocks within the system: stocks composing the LTM, stocks that have a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant DFA but are not in the LTM sub-graph (DFA -), and the rest of the stocks not selected by neither the LTM algorithm nor the DFA (Rest). d reports the leading indicator (right axis) computed on the LTM members (blue line), on DFA -members (red line), and on the Rest of the stocks (yellow line). These indicators have been smoothed based on a Lowess (locally weighted scatter-plot smoothing) /uniFB01 lter and compared with the dynamics of the underlying reference index displayed in gray (left axis). Vertical bars correspond to crisis events affecting the /uniFB01 nancial market such as the banking sector ratings downgrades of 2007, the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the European Debt crisis of 2011, and the Chinese stock market crisis of 2015 -2016. Error bounds are computed by performing 500 bootstrapping re-sampling of stocks' returns from the empirical distribution of the observed data and computing for each run the LTM indicator. Shaded areas represent the 5 -95% con /uniFB01 dence intervals. Two-sample Kolmogorov -Smirnov (KS) test provides evidence about the statistical difference between I LTM and the indicators computed on DFA -and Rest. The pairwise KS statistics of I LTM vs. the indicators for DFA -and Rest are 0.95 and 0.99 at 1% signi /uniFB01 cance level, respectively, thus suggesting that they are from different continuous distributions. e -g show the dynamics of the components of the leading indicator; from the left to the right: the absolute auto-covariance of stocks' returns ( e ), the within cluster absolute Pearson ' s correlation ( f ) and the between clusters absolute Pearson ' s correlation ( g ).

Upper panels of Fig. 1 show the absolute values of both the correlation and the AC for the LTM members and for the other stocks not included in the LTM. Figure 1a refers to an unstable period (centered around 08-06-2009), while Fig. 1b refers to a stable phase (centered around 21-04-2010). Figure 1c shows the schematic diagram of the sets of stocks composing the system: the LTM group (labeled as LTM), the stocks that have a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant DFA, but that are not in the LTM sub-graph (labeled as DFA -), and the rest of the stocks not selected by neither the LTM algorithm nor the DFA (labeled as Rest). Figure 1d shows the dynamics of the underlying index (in gray), the pattern of I LTM t referring to the LTM members (blue line) and the analogous indicators computed on stocks belonging to the DFA -group (red line) and on the Rest group (yellow line). Figure 1 shows how, during unstable phases, the LTM emerges in the correlation matrix, displaying also relatively high values of the ACs (Fig. 1a). On the\ncontrary, the module is indistinguishable from the remaining part of the system during ' business as usual ' phases (Fig. 1b). In a nutshell, I LTM t increases and assumes higher values around periods of market instability than during a tranquil period. For instance, during the 2008 global /uniFB01 nancial crisis, I LTM t starts to increase prior to the outbreak of the market and it reaches a local maximum approximately in correspondence of the onset of the crisis. Figure 1d also points out that I LTM t shows an increasing dynamics in correspondence of major events affecting the market, such as the banking sector ratings downgrades of 2007, the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the European Debt crisis of 2011, and the Chinese stock market crisis of 2015 -2016. Moreover, I LTM t shows a sharp increase also for transitions occurring during positive market trends, as for instance in the recovery period after the global /uniFB01 nancial crisis and at the end of the sample period. By contrast, the dynamics of both DFA -and the Rest groups seem less informative in distinguishing phases of instability in the market as reported in Fig. 1d. Error bounds are computed by performing 500 bootstraps re-sampling by randomly permuting stocks ' returns. Every bootstrap sample allows acquiring an estimate of I LTM t , which is used to compute the distribution of the indicator and to estimate the error bound as the 5 -95th percentiles of such distribution.\nOur analysis of the system at different points in time is able to identify stages of accumulation of market instability by detecting qualitative changes in the structure of the interactions among market participants.\nThe dynamics of the LTM mimics some behavioral attitudes of market participants, such as positive feedbacks and herding behaviors that reverberate in the path of stock prices. The former empirically translates into an increased AC of stock returns, while the latter empirically drives an increase of the correlation of such returns. The lower panels of Fig. 1 (panels e, f, and g) show the time dynamics of the components of I LTM t as described by Eq. (1). From the left to the right: the absolute AC of stocks ' returns (panel e), the within-group absolute Pearson ' s correlation (panel f), and the between groups absolute Pearson ' s correlation (panel g). These components jointly contribute to detect the emergence of phases of cumulative market instabilities. In particular, the AC signals the presence of positive feedbacks around the outbreak of the global /uniFB01 nancial crisis and of its rebound, while high correlation values between the LTM members indicate the presence of a bunch of stocks having strong synchronized patterns, which deviate from the behavior of the rest of the system. Notice that when these components are evaluated separately, they do not provide a clear interpretation of market conditions, while only once jointly considered they convey a meaningful signal.",

The lower panels of Fig. 1 (panels e, f, and g) show the time dynamics of the components of I LTM t as described by Eq. (1). From the left to the right: the absolute AC of stocks ' returns (panel e), the within-group absolute Pearson ' s correlation (panel f), and the between groups absolute Pearson ' s correlation (panel g). These components jointly contribute to detect the emergence of phases of cumulative market instabilities. In particular, the AC signals the presence of positive feedbacks around the outbreak of the global /uniFB01 nancial crisis and of its rebound, while high correlation values between the LTM members indicate the presence of a bunch of stocks having strong synchronized patterns, which deviate from the behavior of the rest of the system. Notice that when these components are evaluated separately, they do not provide a clear interpretation of market conditions, while only once jointly considered they convey a meaningful signal.",

        "text": "Detects the emergence of market instabilities by quantifying self-organizing processes arising from stock returns co-movements.\n\nI LTM t is a dynamic indicator whose members may vary in time. Changes in the LTM composition are important to identify the drivers of the upcoming period of instability. In order to investigate the composition of the LTM sub-graph, its size and the entry -exit dynamics of the stocks in the module, we report, in Fig. 2a, the stability coef /uniFB01 cient of the LTM computed as the portion of stocks that belong to the module during two consecutive days (green line). We also report the size of the LTM (in red) and that of the group DFA -(in blue), expressed as percentages to the total number of stocks composing the reference index. In the lower part of Fig. 2a, we also report the correlation between the number of stocks selected by the DFA procedure and the average correlation of these stocks ' returns. This helps us to verify whether a rise in the number of stocks with a signi /uniFB01 cant DFA exponent is related to the growth of the average correlation of the returns associated with these stocks, and thus to a higher likelihood of being LTM members. When most of the stocks with a signi /uniFB01 cant DFA exponent belong to the LTM (see red line), we observe a stable dynamics of the leading module (see green line) or, to put it differently, a low turnover of the stocks inside the LTM. On the contrary, the LTM stability drastically decreases when there exists a considerable amount of stocks with a signi /uniFB01 cant DFA exponent that are not part of the leading module (see blue line). Indeed, we observe positive and high values of the correlation when most of the stocks selected by the DFA also belong to the LTM as, for instance, during the 2008 global /uniFB01 nancial crises and during the last semester of 2015, after the Renmimbi devaluation, while low values of the correlation are associated with periods of substantial changes of the LTM members. The negative Pearson ' s correlation ( -0.19) between the LTM stability coef /uniFB01 cient and the size of the subset of stocks composing the DFA -group (i.e., not included in the leading module) indicates that new leading modules are likely to emerge in those periods in which there are stocks with signi /uniFB01 cant DFA exponents but with poorly correlated returns. In the Section 3.4 of\nFig. 2 LTM membership stability. a Shows in green the percentage of stocks that belong to the LTM for two consecutive trading days (LTM stability), while the red line stands for the percentage of stocks belonging to the LTM. The blue line emphasizes the percentage of DFA -stocks. The black line shows the value of the correlation (Corr) between the number of stocks selected by the DFA and the average correlation of these stocks' returns, for those having a DFA exponent signi /uniFB01 cantly larger than 1/2 (AC DFA up-tail), while the gray line refers to stocks with a DFA exponent signi /uniFB01 cantly lower than 1/2 (AC DFA low-tail). Finally, the dynamics of the series are compared with the market index (reported in orange). b Shows the distributions of pairs of stocks such that both stocks have Hurst exponent outside the interval 0.2 -0.8 (in black), of pairs such that none of them is outside the interval 0.2 -0.8 (in green) and those with only one stock belonging to such interval (in red).\nFig. 3 The buy/sell signals provided by the dynamics of I LTM t and of its members ' returns together with the obtained Pro /uniFB01 ts and Losses (P&L). The /uniFB01 gure reports, in a , the forecast dynamics of the benchmark index (green-red colors stand for buy and sell signals, respectively) together with the P&L of the investment strategy based on I LTM t (blue line). The P&L of an investment strategy based on the value at risk (VaR), that is, the maximum potential loss computed on a daily time horizon with an interval of con /uniFB01 dence of 0.975 is also reported (black line) as a comparative measure. The true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives obtained by investing following I LTM t are 53%, 47%, 49%, and 51%, respectively, while for the strategy based on the VaR, we obtain 49%, 51%, 52%, and 48%. Finally, the brown line refers to the P&L evolution obtained by considering an investment strategy based on the indicator proposed by ref. 58 , while the cyan line shows the P&L obtained when considering only the average correlation among stocks' returns. In b , we report the accuracy and precision measures of the proposed investment strategy conditionally on the forecast of the market index returns larger than a certain percentile of their distribution in absolute terms.\nthe Supplementary information, we also report that, on average, stocks stay continuously in the leading module for about 1.5 months. Figure 2b shows the distributions of the correlations between pairs of stocks such that both stocks have Hurst exponent outside the interval 0.2 -0.8 (in black) in comparison with the pairs such that none of them is outside that interval (in green) or such that only one of the stock in the pair belongs to that interval (in red). The shifting to the right of the distribution for the stocks with Hurst exponent outside the interval 0.2 -0.8 suggests that the DFA selects assets with high correlated returns. In other words, an increase of the number of stocks with a signi /uniFB01 cant DFA exponent implies an increase of the average correlation of the returns associated with these stocks and subsequently to a higher probability of entering the LTM.\nmarket dynamics. In other words, whenever I LTM t falls in the right tail of its empirical distribution, a switch between a long or short (or vice versa) investment position is possible depending on the average returns of the LTM members. More speci /uniFB01 cally, we refer to values of the I LTM t larger than the 95th percentile of its empirical distribution as the trigger for switching the investment exposure: if the average return of the stocks composing the LTM sub-graph is positive at time t , then we opt for a buy signal in that day; otherwise, the strategy goes short.\nThe predictive performance . We assess the predictive performance of I LTM t by testing an investment strategy that consists of two steps: /uniFB01 rst, the detection of a cumulative process leading to a phase of instability and, second, the identi /uniFB01 cation of the market direction. As for the /uniFB01 rst point, a thresholding approach for extracting signals from I LTM t appears not suitable, since it would require the prior knowledge of the out-of-sample distribution. Therefore, the most recent value of the indicator is compared against its empirical distribution computed over the previous three trading weeks (15 working days). If this value belongs to the right tail of the distribution, then the LTM is interpreted as signaling a cumulative process leading to market instability. Instead, to detect the direction of the market trend, we exploit the most recent returns of the LTM members, averaging among such values at the day corresponding to the investment decision. If the average value of the returns is positive, then the signal conveyed by the LTM indicates the arrival of a shift towards a bullish equilibrium; otherwise, it stands for a declining and bearish",

DFA 28 -30 is employed in the /uniFB01 rst step of the analysis to /uniFB01 lter stocks presenting long-term memory. The returns of these stocks are then clusterized according to their correlation values in order to identify the module approaching the phase transition towards a new equilibrium.\nThe DFA method comprises the following steps. In the /uniFB01 rst step, the data series y ( k ), consisting in the stocks returns, is shifted by its mean < y > and integrated (i.e., cumulatively summed) as follows:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nIn the second step, the transformed series is segmented in windows of various length Δ l . For each segmentation, and repeatedly for all values of Δ l , the summed data are /uniFB01 t with a polynomial x Δ l ( k ). By this, the mean squared residual is found as:\nwhere L is the total number of data points. In our analysis, we have applied a linear /uniFB01 t with L set to 200 days. It is worth to remark that F ( Δ l ) can be viewed as the average of the summed squares of the residual computed in the windows.\nFinally, a log -log graph of F ( Δ l ) against Δ l is drawn. This relationship is expected to be linear if power law scaling is present. In other words, a straight line on this log -log graph indicates statistical self-af /uniFB01 nity expressed as F ( Δ l ) ∝ ( Δ l ) α . The scaling exponent α is calculated as the slope of a straight line /uniFB01 t to the log -log graph of Δ l against F ( Δ l ) using least squares. This scaling parameter is a measure of the presence of self-similarity and, therefore, of long-term memory in the signal, as it tracks down the scaling of dispersion around a regressor for increasing window sizes. In particular, the value of α can describe the following signal behaviors: if 0 < α < 0.5, then the signal has long-term memory and it is anti-correlated; if 0.5 < α < 1, the signal has long-term memory and it is correlated; if α = 0.5, the signal is uncorrelated (has no memory); /uniFB01 nally, if 1 < α < 2, the signal is nonstationary.\nThe /uniFB02 uctuation function has a relationship with the AC of stationary process 56 . Indeed, the square of the /uniFB02 uctuation function F ( Δ l ) can be written as a function of the autocorrelation as:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nbeing ACo( b ) the autocorrelation function. Thus, in terms of AC, for a linear detrending, it is straightforward to compute W ( Δ l ) and Lb ( Δ l ), as:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nThe /uniFB02 uctuation function of DFA is therefore fully determined by the AC(1) and by the variance V (1) of the process. For a long-range correlated process, these components are dominant on all time windows and hence a single scaling range with the correct exponent exists.\nOur study starts by assessing the signi /uniFB01 cance of the DFA coef /uniFB01 cients considering the results computed from the original data and from surrogate data, namely, data obtained by independent time permutation for each stock returns. In other words, for a given time series we obtain its randomized (shuf /uniFB02 ed) counterpart by randomly rearranging time stamps attributed to each element in the series.\nBy comparing original results to those obtained for randomized data, we are able to wash out stocks that presents DFA coef /uniFB01 cients in line with the one observed from the shuf /uniFB02 ed case. Basically, we identify the 5 -95th percentiles of the DFA coef /uniFB01 cients distribution as reference thresholds for assessing the statistical signi /uniFB01 cance of the DFA value. Stocks with extreme values of the DFA, that is, stocks with DFA coef /uniFB01 cients belonging to the tails of the distribution, will be then clusterized to obtain an indicator of price co-movement whose dynamics will be used to identify the occurrence of market instabilities and, accordingly, to distinguish between upward and downward market phases.\nThe leading temporal module . In what follows, we describe the methodology that allows us to identify a general signal indicating an imminent bifurcation. This signal is associated with the presence of an LTM, whose statistical properties re /uniFB02 ect a transition of the underlying system to another state. In particular, it can be shown that, when a system is undergoing a bifurcation, the following general temporal and spatial properties hold: a group of stocks displays an average within PCC that drastically increases in absolute value; the average between PCC of stocks in this group and other stocks in the rest of the system will greatly decrease in absolute value; the average AC of stocks belonging to this group increases in absolute value. If all the three above-mentioned conditions are simultaneously satis /uniFB01 ed, we call the group of stocks ful /uniFB01 lling these requirements the LTM of the system 51,57,58 .\nWe now sketch the theoretical background at the basis of our indicator of market instability. Assume that the following discrete-time dynamical system describes the law of motion of a /uniFB01 nancial market, for example, in terms of stock prices or returns:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere Z t ð Þ 1⁄4 z 1 t ð Þ ; :::; z n t ð Þ ð Þ is a n -dimensional state vector representing stocks returns, P 1⁄4 p 1 ; :::; p s /C0 /C1 is an s -dimensional parameter vector representing slowly changing factors (e.g., news on earnings or pro /uniFB01 ts, anticipated takeovers or mergers, etc.) and ε 1⁄4 ε 1 ; :::; ε n ð Þ is a n -dimensional stochastic component with ε i Gaussian white noise with zero means and covariances κ ij 1⁄4 Cov ð ε i ; ε j Þ . In general, we assume f : R n ́ R s ! R n is a nonlinear vector-valued function. In order to apply theoretical results on bifurcations of a general discrete-time dynamical model, we consider only the deterministic skeleton of the system, that is, we set ε ( t ) = 0. Furthermore, let us assume that the following conditions for Eq. (7) hold: /C22 Z is a /uniFB01 xed point of (7), that is /C22 Z 1⁄4 f /C22 Z ; P ð Þ ; there exists a value P c such that one or a complex conjugate pair of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of Eq. (7) evaluated at the /uniFB01 xed point /C22 Z is equal to 1 in modulus; when P ≠ P c the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of (7) are generally not 1 in modulus.\nThese conditions, along with other transversality conditions, imply that the system undergoes a transition at /C22 Z or a codimension-one bifurcation 59 . The parameter P c , at which the transition for the equilibrium value /C22 Z occurs, is called a bifurcation value (or a critical transition value) where a sudden qualitative or topological change takes place. The bifurcation is generic from a mathematical viewpoint, that is, almost all bifurcations for a general system satisfy these conditions. Around the /uniFB01 xed point /C22 Z , it is possible to linearize the system described by Eq. (7) as:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere J 1⁄4 J P ð Þ denotes the Jacobian matrix of (7). By de /uniFB01 ning X 1⁄4 Z /C0 /C22 Z , it is possible to shift the /uniFB01 xed point to the origin, and the system characterized by Eq. (8) can be re-written as:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere J is a full-rank matrix that also depends on the vector P . Since the Jacobian matrix J is of full rank, then there exists a full-rank matrix S satisfying:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nBy de /uniFB01 ning Y = S -1 X , and reintroducing the stochastic component ε , the linearized version of the original system can be re-written as:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->",

        "text": "Provides a detailed explanation of the mathematical framework used to identify and characterize market instabilities, specifically focusing on the relationship between eigenvalues, auto-covariance, and the emergence of a leading module (LTM) in a financial system.\n\nBy /uniFB01 xing the value of parameter P before reaching P c , either J or Λ is a constant matrix of full rank and we may end up with three cases: real and distinct eigenvalues, real and coincident eigenvalues, and complex eigenvalues.\nIf the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces with real eigenvalues is n , then there exists a non-singular matrix S satisfying Λ 1⁄4 S /C0 1 JS 1⁄4 diag λ 1 ; :::; λ n ð Þ being λ i the i th eigenvalue of the system (11). Without loss of generality, we may regard the /uniFB01 rst element λ 1 j j as being the nearest to 1, that is, the dominant eigenvalue, whose change leads to the state shift. If matrix J does not have linearly independent eigenvectors, there exists a non-singular matrix S making Λ block diagonal. We can always move the block with the largest eigenvalue in modulus, which is also the nearest to 1, to the /uniFB01 rst entry of Λ . Finally, in the case of complex eigenvalues there is a non-singular matrix S making Λ block diagonal where each two-dimensional block matrix has a pair of complex conjugated eigenvalues whose moduli are <1. As before we move the block in which the eigenvalues have the largest modulus to the /uniFB01 rst entry of Λ . Therefore, irrespective of which case occurs, the /uniFB01 rst element of Λ is the dominant eigenvalue, that is, the one nearest to 1 in modulus, whose change\nactually leads to the state shift from the /uniFB01 xed point. Furthermore, all the eigenvalues (or their moduli) of matrix Λ are within [0, 1) and there is at least one dominant eigenvalue approaching 1 in modulus when P → P c .\nFor simplicity, we shall show the statistical properties of the original variables Z considering only the case of real and distinct eigenvalues, but the same conclusion applies for the other two cases in a similar manner 58 .\nSince Λ is a full diagonal matrix, we have the variance V ( ⋅ ), the covariance C ( ⋅ ), the auto-covariance AC( ⋅ ), and the Pearson correlation coef /uniFB01 cient PCC( ⋅ ) of the autoregressive process expressed in Eq. (11) read as:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nThe dynamics of the original variable can be written as:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nThus, the variance and covariance of the original variables are given by:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nThe correlation is given by:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhile the auto-covariance reads as:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nEquations (19) and (20) relate the empirical signals of the original system (7) with the value assumed by the dominant eigenvalue of the latent system (11). It is worth to note that an increase of the variance, covariance, and autocorrelation of the original system could be due to both a proximity of a tipping point or a strong and unexpected exogenous shock in the stochastic component of the autoregressive process in (11).\nThe temporal and spatial statistical properties that signal an imminent bifurcation can thus be summarized as follows: if a variable zi is related to y 1 , that is, s i 1 ≠ 0, then the absolute value of the auto-covariance AC ( zi ( t ), zi ( t -1)) increases greatly as λ 1 → 1; otherwise, it is bounded; if variables zi and zj are related to y 1 , that is, s i 1 ≠ 0, s j 1 ≠ 0, then j PCC ð z i ð t Þ ; z j ð t ÞÞj ! 1 as λ 1 → 1; if variables zi and zj are not related to y 1 , that is, s i 1 = 0, s j 1 = 0, then j PCC ð z i ð t Þ ; z j ð t ÞÞj ! a with a 2 0 ; 1 ð Þ as λ 1 → 1; if only variable zi is related to y 1 but zj is not, that is, s i 1 ≠ 0, s j 1 = 0, then j PCC ð z i ð t Þ ; z j ð t ÞÞj ! 0 as λ 1 → 1.\nLTM identi /uniFB01 cation . Stocks zi in the system are represented as a dynamical temporal graph Gt = ( Nt , Et ) composed by Nt nodes, while edges Et denote the pairwise correlation (PCC( zi ( t ), zj ( t ))) between each pair of stocks ' returns ( zi ( t ), zj ( t )) computed over a given moving window. This approach relies on the identi /uniFB01 cation of two main sets of stocks: (i) the LTM denoted as N LTM t and (ii) the remaining stocks Nt n N LTM t not belonging to the leading module. To detect whether the system is approaching a new equilibrium, we expect that 58,59 : (i) the absolute value of the auto-covariance of the time series of the LTM members in N LTM t increases; (ii) the absolute value of the correlation between stocks in the LTM increases as well; (iii) conversely, the absolute value of the correlation between a stock in N LTM t and another stock outside the LTM decreases to zero.\nMore practically, to identify the LTM we apply a hierarchical clustering procedure that distinguishes different groups or modules of stocks. We characterize each identi /uniFB01 ed module H by summarizing the statistical features reported above through a synthetic indicator. Let us denote the mean of the absolute value of the auto-covariance of the nodes in N H t as < j AC H t j > , the mean of the absolute value of the correlation coef /uniFB01 cients between members of the H-th module as < j PCC H t j > ,\nand let < j PCC e H t j > be the analogous between stocks in N H t and the remaining stocks. The corresponding synthetic indicator for stocks within each module is de /uniFB01 ned accordingly as:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nThen, the module with the highest value of I H t is assumed as the LTM of the underlying system and the corresponding indicator, labeled I LTM t , is employed for monitoring the reinforcement of market instabilities. This indicator is expected to sharply increase when a new phase is about to be reached by the underlying system, representing therefore an effective marker for the identi /uniFB01 cation of a cumulative process leading to a new system con /uniFB01 guration 51,58,60 . Hence, we expect the LTM to emerge more clearly when the system is experiencing a transition, meaning that its members become more cohesive and distinct from the rest of the network. In Supplementary information we present a pseudo-code that formalizes the procedure (see Supplementary Fig. 6).\nReporting summary .

It is worth to note that an increase of the variance, covariance, and autocorrelation of the original system could be due to both a proximity of a tipping point or a strong and unexpected exogenous shock in the stochastic component of the autoregressive process in (11).\nThe temporal and spatial statistical properties that signal an imminent bifurcation can thus be summarized as follows: if a variable zi is related to y 1 , that is, s i 1 ≠ 0, then the absolute value of the auto-covariance AC ( zi ( t ), zi ( t -1)) increases greatly as λ 1 → 1; otherwise, it is bounded; if variables zi and zj are related to y 1 , that is, s i 1 ≠ 0, s j 1 ≠ 0, then j PCC ð z i ð t Þ ; z j ð t ÞÞj ! 1 as λ 1 → 1; if variables zi and zj are not related to y 1 , that is, s i 1 = 0, s j 1 = 0, then j PCC ð z i ð t Þ ; z j ð t ÞÞj ! a with a 2 0 ; 1 ð Þ as λ 1 → 1; if only variable zi is related to y 1 but zj is not, that is, s i 1 ≠ 0, s j 1 = 0, then j PCC ð z i ð t Þ ; z j ð t ÞÞj ! 0 as λ 1 → 1.\nLTM identi /uniFB01 cation . Stocks zi in the system are represented as a dynamical temporal graph Gt = ( Nt , Et ) composed by Nt nodes, while edges Et denote the pairwise correlation (PCC( zi ( t ), zj ( t ))) between each pair of stocks ' returns ( zi ( t ), zj ( t )) computed over a given moving window. This approach relies on the identi /uniFB01 cation of two main sets of stocks: (i) the LTM denoted as N LTM t and (ii) the remaining stocks Nt n N LTM t not belonging to the leading module. To detect whether the system is approaching a new equilibrium, we expect that 58,59 : (i) the absolute value of the auto-covariance of the time series of the LTM members in N LTM t increases; (ii) the absolute value of the correlation between stocks in the LTM increases as well; (iii) conversely, the absolute value of the correlation between a stock in N LTM t and another stock outside the LTM decreases to zero.\nMore practically, to identify the LTM we apply a hierarchical clustering procedure that distinguishes different groups or modules of stocks. We characterize each identi /uniFB01 ed module H by summarizing the statistical features reported above through a synthetic indicator. Let us denote the mean of the absolute value of the auto-covariance of the nodes in N H t as < j AC H t j > , the mean of the absolute value of the correlation coef /uniFB01 cients between members of the H-th module as < j PCC H t j > ,\nand let < j PCC e H t j > be the analogous between stocks in N H t and the remaining stocks. The corresponding synthetic indicator for stocks within each module is de /uniFB01 ned accordingly as:\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nThen, the module with the highest value of I H t is assumed as the LTM of the underlying system and the corresponding indicator, labeled I LTM t , is employed for monitoring the reinforcement of market instabilities. This indicator is expected to sharply increase when a new phase is about to be reached by the underlying system, representing therefore an effective marker for the identi /uniFB01 cation of a cumulative process leading to a new system con /uniFB01 guration 51,58,60 . Hence, we expect the LTM to emerge more clearly when the system is experiencing a transition, meaning that its members become more cohesive and distinct from the rest of the network. In Supplementary information we present a pseudo-code that formalizes the procedure (see Supplementary Fig. 6).\nReporting summary .
