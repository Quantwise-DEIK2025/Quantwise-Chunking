        "text": "Provides a description of EPR spectroscopy and its application for identifying and quantifying vacancy defects in silicon crystals.\n\nEPR spectroscopy detects unpaired electrons localized at defects such as vacancies and impurities in a sample. EPR spectra are recorded by irradiating the sample placed in a microwave cavity resonator with the microwave (frequency ν) and sweeping an external magnetic field B . Resonant microwave absorptions (i.e., EPR signals) are observed under the resonance condition, where the energy of a microwave photon is equal to the Zeeman splitting of the energy levels of an unpaired electron\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere h is the Planck constant, g is the gyromagnetic factor ( g -factor) of the unpaired electron, and μ B is the Bohr magneton. The g -factor for free electrons has been determined to be 2.002319 · · · with a relative standard uncertainty of 2.6 × 10 -13 [8]. The g -factor of the electron localized at a defect has an inherent deviation caused by spin-orbit coupling. Therefore, measurements of the g -factor are useful for classifying defects.\nFurthermore, since the wave function of the unpaired electron has a spatial distribution reflecting the arrangement of atoms around a defect, the angular dependence of the g -factor provides information on the symmetry of the defect in a crystal sample. By choosing a particular Cartesian coordinate system, the effective value of the g -factor for the defect in a certain direction g eff is given by\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere gx , gy , and gz are the principal values of the g -factor and cos θ x , cos θ y , and cos θ z are the direction cosines of the magnetic field in the selected Cartesian coordinate system.\nFig. 2. Simulation results of the anisotropic EPR signal of the positively charged monovacancy defect V + with the principal values of gx = 2.0087(3), gy = 1.9989(3), and gz = 1.9989(3) [11]. This defect shows axial symmetry about the < 100 > direction of the crystal. (a) Angular dependence of EPR line positions. Angle θ : angle between the [100] direction of the silicon single crystal and the magnetic field rotating in the ( 0 ̄ 11 ) plane. (b) First-derivative EPR spectra for θ = 0¡, 30¡, 60¡, and 90¡. For this simulation, a microwave frequency of 9.421 GHz and Lorentzian lineshapes with a half-width at halfmaximum /Gamma1 = 0.1 mT was assumed. In an EPR spectrum, multiple EPR lines appear depending on the direction of the magnetic field owing to the rotational symmetry of the crystal. Taking into account the symmetry of the silicon crystal, the maximum number of EPR lines observed is 12.\nWhen the arrangement of atoms around the defect has cubic symmetry such as tetrahedral group T d, all three principal values of the g -factor are equal and such an EPR signal is expressed as 'isotropic.' Otherwise, the EPR signal is referred to as 'anisotropic.'\nWatkins [6] identified anisotropic EPR signals of vacancy defects in silicon crystals, generated by high-energy electron irradiation. The principal values of the g -factor range from 1.9989 to 2.0087 for positively charged monovacancy defect V + and from 2.0028 to 2.0151 for negatively charged monovacancy defect V -. Such anisotropy of EPR signals is caused by the geometrical distortion of the four silicon atoms around a vacancy defect due to the Jahn-Teller effect [9].\nIn addition, charged divacancy, trivacancy, tetravacancy, and pentavacancy defects V ± 2 , V -3 , V -4 , and V -5 and monovacancy defects trapped by impurities ( V O) -and ( V P) 0 in silicon crystals have been identified by EPR spectroscopy [6], [10]. These anisotropic signals of the vacancy defects should appear in the magnetic field ranging from 334 to 337 mT at the microwave frequency of 9.421 GHz used in our study. Fig. 2 shows the simulation results of anisotropic EPR signals of the positively charged monovacancy defect V + in a silicon single crystal [11] as an example, which is available using the webbased database system [12].\nThe angular dependence of the EPR signals observed for irradiation-damaged silicon crystals is explained by the geometrical distortion of atoms around each type of vacancy, based on the Jahn-Teller effect. Because the atoms around the vacancy in undamaged silicon crystals should have the geometrical distortion similar to that of the irradiation-damaged silicon crystals, based on the Jahn-Teller effect, we believe that the identification performed on irradiation-damaged samples using EPR is applicable to undamaged samples used in this paper.\nAmong the 415 types of defects in silicon identified in previous EPR studies [13], the largest vacancy agglomerate is negatively charged pentavacancy defect V -5 [14]. On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, the largest vacancy agglomerate estimated using PALS is hexavacancy defect V 6 in an electron-irradiated FZ silicon doped with phosphorus for an estimated positron lifetime of 400 ps [15].\nFurthermore, when the wave function of an unpaired electron spreads to the position of an impurity atom having nuclear spin I , where I is an integer or half-integer, the EPR signal splits into (2 I + 1) lines owing to the hyperfine interaction. Since the number of lines and splitting width of the hyperfine splitting depend on the impurity atom and the wave function of the unpaired electron, they are useful for identifying impurity defects.\nThe 28 Si single crystal used in this paper contains 29 Si atoms, which have a nuclear spin I = 1/2, with an amount-ofsubstance fraction of only 4 × 10 -5 [16]. This brings about relatively narrow line widths of the EPR signals and makes it possible to acquire high-resolution EPR spectra. This is a great advantage in determining a small amount of vacancy defect concentration compared to the measurement on silicon crystals with a natural isotope ratio, which contains 29 Si atoms with an amount-of-substance fraction of approximately 0.047, causing inhomogeneous broadening in the EPR signals owing to the hyperfine interaction.\nQuantitative determination of the number of EPR-active defects can be achieved through comparison with a reference sample with a known number of unpaired electrons. This is based on the measurement principle that each EPR absorption intensity is proportional to the number of unpaired electrons in a sample. When we use the reference sample with the number of unpaired electrons n R, the number of unpaired electrons localized at a certain type of defect X in the test sample n X, is given by\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nwhere ( A X / A R ) is the ratio of the EPR absorption intensities for the test and reference samples and ( T X / T R ) is the ratio of the absolute temperatures of the test and reference samples being measured. Here, we used Curie's law, which states that the magnetization of the paramagnetic material is approximately inversely proportional to the absolute temperature.\nThe concentration of defect X with an unpaired electron in the test sample c X is obtained by dividing the number of unpaired electrons localized at the defect n X by a sample volume V s\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\nWe used a crystal of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate CuSO4 · 5H2O (molar mass M = 249 . 69 g mol -1 ) with a mass of 12.53 mg as the reference sample, which retains one unpaired electron per molecule. The number of unpaired electrons in the reference sample n R was estimated to be 3.02(3) × 10 19 . The EPR absorption intensity of the reference sample A R was determined at T R = 298 K before measurements on the test sample using the same instrument.\nAll EPR measurements were carried out using a Bruker Bio-Spin E500 X -band spectrometer equipped with a superhighQ cavity ER 4122SHQ. The signal-to-noise ratio of the instrument is 3000 for the paramagnetic radical standard material, called weak pitch, having a linear density of unpaired electrons of around 10 13 cm -1 . The detectable minimum number of unpaired electrons in the sample placed in the microwave cavity resonator was estimated to be around 10 10 , which is ultimately limited by the thermal noise of the detector and amplifiers [17]. The quality factor of the microwave cavity resonator Q reaches 7500 under the best measurement conditions. The sample temperature was controlled from 4 K to room temperature using an Oxford ESR900 He-flow cryostat.

However, in our experiment, the EPR signal of nitrogen impurity, which was considered to be contained in the AVO28 crystal with a relatively high concentration, was not detected. This can be explained by the geometrical structure of atoms determined by Jones et al. [30], where most of the nitrogen atoms in silicon crystals exist in the form of interstitial atoms without unpaired electrons (Si3 ≡ N:, where the colon sign symbolizes a lone pair of electrons).\nTo the best of our knowledge, vacancies captured by nitrogen impurities have not been identified using EPR. They are not listed in the collected EPR data of the 415 types of defects in silicon [13].\nAbe et al. [31] observed an FZ silicon crystal after copper decoration using X-ray topography. They reported that the vacancy concentration has a maximum value at the center of the radial direction of the crystal. The sample used in our EPR measurement was located near the rim of the AVO28 crystal. We need to perform an EPR measurement on the sample near the center of the crystal to obtain additional results in the near future.",

Therefore, we conducted quantitative EPR measurements on 28 Si single crystal AVO28 at 25 K both in a dark environment and under illumination. The following conclusions were obtained.\n- 1) Isotropic EPR spectra from phosphorus impurity and defects near the mechanically damaged surfaces were observed. The concentration of phosphorus impurity in the AVO28 crystal was determined to be 3.2(5) × 10 12 cm -3 under illumination, which was consistent with that estimated using FTIR spectroscopy, 10(10) × 10 12 cm -3 .\n- 3) As a result, the mass deficit correction due to the nine types of vacancy defects was estimated to be 0.0(2) θ g for 1-kg AVO28 spheres.\n- 2) Anisotropic EPR signals of vacancy defects in the AVO28 crystal were not observed.
