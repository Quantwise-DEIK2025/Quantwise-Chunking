The graph's horizontal axis represents dates, and the vertical axis indicates “Probability”.\n\nThe graph begins with a high probability value around 0.648. Over the following dates, the probability steadily decreases, reaching a low of approximately 0.532.  The graph appears to show a series of events related to securities margin trading, RMB speculation, and a commercial draft. The slope of the line suggests a consistent downward movement, indicating a decline in whatever is being measured by the probability values. The graph doesn't represent a logo or brand.",
